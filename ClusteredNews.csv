He has won eight of his nine professional fights and is renowned for his ability to knock out opponents clinically with accurate elbows and kicks. His first fight of real meaning had baying crowds around it, but it was far from the bright lights of the stadiums where he now competes. He was 11 years old at school in England, walking to the school field terrified to take on a physically bigger boy who had bullied him mercilessly. Peacock was born with one arm shorter than the other and was sick of the taunts. His decision to fight back that day defined the rest of his life.“When the last bell rang for the end of school, I knew I had another option. I was walking out of the school and I knew I could keep going straight to the school field or I could turn and walk to my mum’s car 20 yards away and go home. It was a Friday. I could come back in on Monday and see what happens, but that wouldn’t be good. The bullying would just keep going and I knew it would never stop.

That question was easy enough to answer during wartime. Ought the precise time and location of games be kept secret? That was up for discussion but ultimately rejected.

About halfway through, he was bumped by a rival car and sent spiraling into a barrier. Seeing red, Ward exited his vehicle and charged down the banked circuit to vent his frustration. Several cars tacked down to the inside-most line to avoid him. But when the car that had ended Ward’s race approached, it veered up toward the young driver, and flung him 25 feet across the track to his death. Spectators at Canandaigua Motorsports Park gasped. They hadn’t just witnessed the horror of a driver killed in competition. They saw Ward, a local hero and ascendent talent, run over by Nascar megastar Tony Stewart.A three-time Cup champion, Stewart, then 43, was moonlighting in the race ahead of a Nascar road race at Watkins Glen. Immediately after Ward’s death, officially ruled an “accident,” public sympathy swamped Stewart. Ward, on the other hand, was demonized as a hothead – and shortly afterwards a drug user when a post-mortem toxicology report didn’t just find THC in Ward’s system, but enough to impair his judgment according to Ontario county district attorney Michael Tantillo. Something about that picture always seemed off. Now a recent documentary shows just how far off, down to the pixel.

Though possession is not everything, against a team that has so much of it, an opponent needs to be almost perfect to get a result, and in the hour after they went behind, Newcastle were close to that, producing a scintillating display of power, bravery and imagination – for which Eddie Howe deserves much praise. It’s one thing saying you plan for your team to attack the defending champions with aggression, another to actually mean it, and something else entirely to convince your players that they’re good enough to pull it off. But Howe did all of that, presiding over a performance that will resonate throughout the league, showing other, more fearful – and for now, at least, more expensively assembled teams – what can be done with the right attitude, while also putting them on notice that Newcastle are coming.

That night, I went to bed broken, exhausted and defeated. I’d run in the T13 5000m at the Paralympic Games, winning silver in the blistering heat of Tokyo. But for a lifetime, it had always been about winning a gold medal. As a 14-year-old, I’d been told at the Athletics Australia offices in Melbourne that I’d been “earmarked” for Tokyo. From that moment onwards, I dreamt about that race every night. Almost a decade later, I was finally in that moment, but those dreams didn’t come true. In the final strides, I knew that moment had slipped through my fingers.I had emptied the tank. I had absolutely nothing left to give, and I’m so bloody proud of the way I kept fighting until the very end. I crossed the finish line, staggered around and then threw up. Time blurs in these moments, but I eventually found myself on a stretcher underneath the stadium. Later, I sat in an ice bath, my mind numb, my upper-body leaning outwards as I threw up into an empty shower cubicle. I felt nothing, but when you dream about a moment for so long and then it happens in the blink of an eye, what more can you feel?

"162","After a terrible season, Lyon now look like the second-best team in Ligue 1 | Eric Devin","1661185466000","PSG look unstoppable but Lyon – the other side with a 100% record in Ligue 1 – are likely to be the best of the restBy Eric Devin for Get French Football NewsRhetoric can be powerful but it also can be a double-edged sword, coming across as bluster if not properly backed up. Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas, who sold a controlling interest in the club to American businessman John Textor this summer, has never been one to mince his words. Having steered the club for 35 years, he has inevitably made the odd misstep, but their run of seven straight Ligue 1 titles in the 2000s and regular appearances in the knockout rounds of European competitions are firm evidence of his acumen.On top of that, the club remains an incubator of top players. Their philosophy is to bring through youngsters who complement more experienced heads in the team, knowing that the young talents will move on to pastures greener and bring in funds for the club. Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso are good recent examples. Lyon also pick up players from other academies and develop them into first-team regulars – the idea being to help Lyon on the pitch as well as financially – think Ferland Mendy, Bruno Guimarães and Tanguy Ndombele. Recently, though, Lyon sides have featured as few as two or three academy graduates – players such as Houssem Aouar, Maxence Caqueret and Anthony Lopes.

"164","Thrills aplenty in the Premier League’s great sportswashing derby | Jonathan Wilson","1661107178000","Newcastle and Manchester City entertained in a six-goal draw but the clubs’ owners and history will not be forgottenPep Guardiola was agitated. He stalked the touchline, hands on hips, brooding. He gestured at Bernardo Silva and, during a break for an injury, gave him lengthy instructions. Manchester City were 1-0 up and creating chances, but Guardiola often serves as his own canary in the mine, his agitation indicating long before it becomes apparent in concrete actions that something is amiss.When Ilkay Gündogan put City ahead in the fifth minute, the assumption was that Eddie Howe was on his way to an 11th defeat in 11 games against Guardiola. Everybody knows the drill: Guardiola praises Howe for the football his side plays, all that passing and so little of that nasty tackling, all that space and so little of that closing down, and then helps himself to a comfortable win: the cumulative goal-difference between the two before kick-off was 31-4 in Guardiola’s favour.

"843","New cancer treatment offers hope to patients out of options","1661144429000","Exclusive: UK trial finds finds combination of drugs can work where tumours have become resistant to immunotherapyA new cancer treatment can stop the disease advancing in patients who are resistant to immunotherapy, doctors have discovered.Immunotherapy uses the immune system to target and kill cancer cells, and can save lives when other treatment options, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, have failed. However, it cannot help all patients, and some tumours can evolve to resist it.Now oncologists in the UK have found a two-pronged treatment – immunotherapy combined with guadecitabine, a novel experimental drug – can reverse a cancer’s resistance to immunotherapy. Patients expected to die after exhausting all treatment options survived much longer, they found.The combination of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, and guadecitabine, a next-generation DNA hypomethylating agent, halted the advance of cancer in more than a third of patients enrolled in the early phase 1 trial. The results are published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer.The dual combination could become an effective new weapon against several forms of cancer, experts at the Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust said.Patients in the trial, from the Royal Marsden and University College London hospital, included those with lung, breast, prostate and bowel cancer.“I think one of the most important things about this trial is that we used multiple different methods to look for changes in the immune system, robustly showing that it was being influenced by the combination treatment,” the study’s chief investigator, Prof Johann de Bono, said.De Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research and a consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden, added: “In the long term we hope that if these effects are confirmed in other patient groups and future studies, guadecitabine and pembrolizumab could help to tackle some of the resistance to immunotherapy we see in too many types of cancer.”The study used pembrolizumab and guadecitabine to treat 34 cancer patients, 30 of whom had their tumours analysed for immune activity and cancer growth. Every three weeks for three years, they had an injection of guadecitabine for four days in a row – and pembrolizumab on the first of those days.Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug that has already proved successful in treating a range of cancers, including lung and skin cancers. However, tumours can develop resistance to it and some patients who initially benefit will eventually get sicker.

The marsupials, formally known as thylacines, were hunted to extinction by European settlers who considered them a threat to their sheep and poultry. However, the 6ft-long creatures may reappear if a group of biotechnologists have their way.The company Colossal Biosciences, along with researchers from the University of Melbourne, plans to “de-extinct” the thylacine by using gene-editing technology. Australia has the fastest rate of mammal extinction in the world; disappearances are down to the arrival of foreign species and wildfires linked to the climate crisis. Scientists argue that in Tasmania the loss of the thylacine left the numbers of smaller marsupials unchecked, leading to over-grazing and threatening a fragile ecological balance.

Here’s what a professional reviewer made of itAs has become the wont of major artists, the debut from the Black Hole dropped so suddenly on Sunday that it might as well have landed from outer space. Which, er, in fact it did. Nasa’s recording of rumbling sound waves from the Perseus galaxy cluster, 200m light years away, sounds, on first hearing, like a lot of submerged wailing – or indeed whales – but like many a classic, takes time to reveal its true complexity and profundity. The 34-second recording is a mantra-like loop or cycle, suggesting the influence of the 1970s German Krautrock bands Neu! and Can, and their gospel of repetition in music.The sounds – striking, eerie, disturbing but strangely soothing and balm-like – have been compared to Björk but will also be recognisable to anyone familiar with Brian Eno’s 1983 ambient colossus Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, which has obviously struck a chord in the outer limits. Strikingly, Nasa’s recording sounds absolutely nothing like Muse’s 2006 epic Supermassive Black Hole, a song that has long been the authority on these things, but now suddenly sounds like the work of a funky three-piece rock band from Teignmouth, rather than prophets of the space-time continuum. One Twitter user has compared the real Black Hole to Pink Floyd’s spacious 1971 masterpiece Echoes, but conceptually, it’s perhaps more in the spirit of their 1968 psychedelic era opus A Saucerful of Secrets. After all, what is a black hole if not a cavernous deep space, which contains all sorts of mysteries and inner meanings?

Immediately lines from famous rappers flood into my head – some classic Biggie, a few Young Thug yelps, the theme to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air – but I’ve got to think up something original.Out of desperation, I decide to rap about my morning routine. Adopting a slow pace and simple rhyme scheme that even the Sugarhill Gang would disdain, I begin: “I wake up at seven and I brush my teeth.” Already I am at a loss. What rhymes with “teeth”? Panicking, I look at the computer in front of me, which is running a demo of iRap, AI software built to assist lyric writing in real time. It has been transcribing my words and offers possible rhymes I might want to use: “heath, sheath, underneath”. Could that work? “Make a bacon sandwich, put some cheese underneath,” I sigh. I have fallen short of even my own low standards. Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/23/ai-rap-technology-music","1070","TECHNOLOGY"

I’d hate to speculate | John Naughton","1659798017000","For the first time in the technology industry’s history, combined real revenue growth is negative rather than positive and some corporations may yet be facing an existential decline  A speculative bubble, wrote Nobel laureate Robert Shiller in Irrational Exuberance, his landmark book on human foolishness, is “a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors, who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement”.Observers of the tech industry are wearily familiar with this kind of irrationality. Throughout 2020 and 2021, as Covid-19 wreaked economic havoc on countries throughout the western world, the tech industry remained strangely untouched by what was happening on the ground. While the rest of us cowered in lockdown, the pandemic made tech bosses and owners insanely richer. Their companies grew faster and became even more profitable while other industries languished. Apple had so much extra cash that it spent $90bn (£74bn) – nearly the gross domestic product of Kenya – buying its own shares. Amazon laid out $50bn in 2021 on warehouses, hiring tens of thousands of employees, ordering fleets of electric vehicles and building cloud computing centres. And so on.

We might invoke grandchildren, at a push great-grandchildren, but after that, it all becomes a bit vague and, well, unimaginable.And while we look with awe and fascination at the Egyptian pyramids, built 5,000 years ago, we seem incapable of thinking, or even contemplating, 5,000 years in the future. That lies in the realm of science fiction, which is tantamount to fantasy. But the chances are, barring a global catastrophe, humanity will still be very much around in 5,000 years, and going by the average existence of mammal species, should still be thriving in 500,000 years.

Its developers explain how they’re trying to make a beat ‘em up that everyone can play If there’s one name synonymous with fighting games, it’s Street Fighter. Dominating arcades in the late 80s and 90s and spawning the living room-conquering Super Nintendo classic Street Fighter II, Capcom’s beat ’em up became a cultural phenomenon. But since the death of the arcade, fighting games have become more niche. While 2016’s Street Fighter V slowly became a competitive esports sensation, it lacked the earlier games’ universal appeal. Now, 31 years after Street Fighter II, Capcom is reinventing its prize fighter for a new generation. Visually, Street Fighter 6 is forging a new identity for the franchise, sporting an eye-catching aesthetic that combines unattainably bulging biceps with attacks that explode in a burst of colour.“I really want to make Street Fighter a game that everyone can play, like it used to be,” producer and series veteran Shuhei Matsumoto tells the Guardian. Offering a radical overhaul to its controls, Street Fighter 6 is a more accessible twist on spin-kicking, fireball-throwing fighting spectacle. A newbie-friendly control option ditches the classic six-button setup of high and low punches and kicks in favour of a simpler three-button structure, allowing first-timers to pull off a Shoryuken without spending months developing the muscle memory.

I played the then-unreleased Nintendo Wii for the first time at my first Gamescom. A few years later, I got a look at Project Natal, Microsoft’s mad motion-controlled game experiment that later became the Kinect. I once had the uncomfortable experience of being driven around Cologne in a limo for 20 minutes, while being shown dodgy footage of a licensed Stargate online game that was never released. For more than 15 years, I have honed my journalistic technique by plying tipsy, jetlagged American game developers for rumours after a few pints of Kölsch by the river.Gamescom has never had the LA glamour of E3; it was always more workmanlike, great from a coverage perspective but light on pizzazz. I’m fond of it though, not least because as the biggest games convention in the world – with more than 300,000 attendees – it challenges the video games industry’s US-centrism. There are many millions of gamers in Europe too, folks! We deserve a big event. PlayStation, Nintendo and EA have eschewed this show for a while, and in their place you get a mish-mash of unexpected exhibitors that reflect gaming tastes on mainland Europe. Simulation games are huge here, and massive swathes of the show floor are usually given over to games like Farming Simulator. PC gaming is bigger here, so point-and-click adventures, war games and strategy games are also more prominent.

Even our honeymoon left me frustrated","1661238005000","I’m sick of always having to make the first move – and usually being turned down. After four years like this, should we get professional help?I am a woman in my 30s who has been in a relationship with my partner (also a woman) for almost four years. Our sex life has never been amazing, but we love each other deeply and when we do have sex it is good. But the frequency is low – we are intimate once every couple of months and she never initiates sex. We recently married and during our week’s  honeymoon had sex once. I’m at the end of my tether with frustration and sadness that she doesn’t seem to want to sleep with me. I’ve tried to talk to her about what’s going on and she is generally dismissive, putting it down to our busy lives. When I brought up the honeymoon and the fact that I was rejected numerous times during a week when we were both relaxed, she didn’t have a response. Is it time to see a sex therapist? I do not want a sexless or low-sex marriage. I love my wife very much, and I don’t doubt that she loves me, but it’s really starting to affect the way I feel about myself. I could wear the hottest outfit or nothing at all and she still wouldn’t make a move. What can we do to change things?A good sex therapist could certainly help. An imbalance of sexual interest between partners can be a source of enormous frustration for both. It can create resentment, anger and even lead to a break-up. With help, you could both gain clarity about each other’s needs, reach an understanding, learn to communicate better – and have the best chance of resolving the situation. Sometimes there is a medical or psychological reason for low desire, and a sex therapist can help identify factors that require special attention. Unfortunately, many people passively accept such an impasse, which – as you have already discovered – can have a devastating effect on one’s self-esteem.

Be less hard on yourself and learn to make ‘I statements’The question I can’t seem to stop gossiping and complaining about the people around me. This primarily happens at work and I am not the only person who does it; it is a toxic environment where bitching is the norm, so it is hard to resist. Every day I give myself a little talk about how I am not going to say a bad word about someone and every day I get sucked into gossip or end up saying something mean. It is the trait I deplore the most in myself and I am starting to believe that deep down I am a horrible person who doesn’t deserve any friends. I used to pride myself on my ability to be honest, opinionated and outspoken, but the balance has tipped into bitterness, whining and impulsive gossiping. The worst part is, when I bitch about someone, I deep down don’t feel negatively about them and am baffled as to why I say such horrible things.I have worked hard on myself in the last few years (becoming sober, going to therapy) and I am ashamed that I have not evolved into a better person. I don’t want to be small-minded by getting a thrill out of bringing others down. I really respect and admire people who are more positive, open minded and can control their thoughts and emotions around others – how do I become that person and say goodbye once and for all to this poisonous part of myself?

It’s one of the hardest – and almost certainly the most scenic – one-day bike races in the world.Mountains and bicycles aren’t natural bedfellows.

He talks about the rail dispute, the stereotyping of working-class people and his clash with Piers MorganIt is rare, these days, for the general secretary of a trade union, let alone a small one, to become a national figure. Yet Mick Lynch has done exactly that. The leader of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), which represents 80,000 members, doesn’t like flattery. Nonetheless, as the rail strikes in Britain enter their third month, he will concede that “a lot of people are telling me I’m doing good”.I meet him in the RMT’s boardroom, round the corner from Euston station in central London, where the RMT recently had 1,000 people turn up at very short notice, to support a picket line in the dispute between railway workers and Network Rail. Lynch looks, in his own words, like “the personification of what an RMT general secretary is”: white, male, bald, 60. He is making the point that he hopes the RMT will be more diverse in the future. He also looks like a man in charge of the moment: relaxed, with an easy sense of humour. I can’t think of a time in my life when that has been the stereotype of a trade unionist.

"2234","From fuel prices to net zero, why is the right blaming everything on lockdown? | Gaby Hinsliff","1661258393000","There is a bizarre trend to lay every ill on those who tried to avoid Covid, rather than a Tory party that’s been in power for 12 yearsWhat is driving the cost of living crisis? It’s not a trick question, or it isn’t meant to be. Most people would naturally say rocketing energy bills, heading now for fivefold what they may be in a normal year; climbing like ivy, snaking and clinging, smothering everything and blotting out the light. The equivalent, says a despairing Greg Jackson of Octopus Energy, of whacking 9p on income tax overnight; more than many mortgages, rents or the nursery bill that once felt crippling. Others may mention rising food prices or the cost of filling the car. But not everyone sees things that way.It was a few weeks ago that I first started noticing a sudden rash of social media accounts, all hammering out the same bitterly aggressive message: if you supported lockdown, don’t come crying to us about this winter’s looming economic catastrophe, because it’s all your fault. “If you tittle-tattled on your neighbour and demanded longer, stricter lockdowns, this is on you,” thundered the influential Conservative lockdown sceptic Ben Goldsmith – brother of the international environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, and until recently a nonexecutive board member of Defra – when the Bank of England bowed to the inevitable this month and forecast a recession. It was, he tweeted, “jaw-dropping to see the peddlers of lockdown … complaining bitterly now as the country is handed the tab”. Although less jaw-dropping, perhaps, than blaming curtain-twitching neighbours for an economic crisis pushing up to half the country towards fuel poverty.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/23/fuel-prices-net-zero-right-blaming-everything-on-lockdown","2029","BUSINESS"

If so, the decision was a shocker. Nine months later, Bulb still sits on the state’s books and the price of running an unhedged operation increases with every spike in the gas price, up about 20% since last Friday.

But rarely was muck filthier or money more brass-necked than in the case of the brown effluent pouring into the Channel off Seaford, or the green algae spreading over Windermere. The English water industry can make all the excuses it likes, but those who find themselves swimming in sewage tend to notice – and wonder why those responsible deserve million-pound salaries. Last year nine water chiefs pocketed over £15m between them, an annual rise of 27%.The dumping of sewage into watercourses is caused simply by storage tanks overflowing. This is currently attributed by the industry to hot weather causing unexpectedly fast run-off. This is supposed to happen only exceptionally rarely.

"2237","UK shoppers are keeping calm and carrying on. Why? | Larry Elliott","1661072245000","Consumers are in either denial about the economy or think they are managing … for nowThe UK economy is a puzzle. Inflation has burst above 10% for the first time since Argentina was gearing up to invade the Falklands in early 1982. Prices are rising far more quickly than wages. Consumer confidence has plumbed depths not seen during any of the many misfortunes of the past half century.And yet, the official data shows the British public is carrying on shopping regardless. Retail sales were higher in July than they were in June despite the progressively tighter squeeze on living standards. Airports are busy with holidaymakers, house prices keep on rising.

Almost all the money for the purchase was provided by my father – who died in July 2020 – as a gift. Even though he died less than seven years after giving me the money, there was no inheritance tax to pay on it because his estate (including the gift) was valued at less than the £325,000 nil-rate band.I am in the process of relocating to Scotland, with a view, once settled, to purchasing another property (this time with my partner) without selling my existing property. My plan for a while has been to rent out my current house – because of the disparity in property values, this should cover any mortgage payments on a new property and allow me to retain the English property as a retirement nest egg to sell 20 to 25 years down the line. I’m aware that I would be liable for capital gains tax (CGT) at that point, although I think I would be able to claim some relief for the years I was living in the house.

He explains the roots of his lifelong passionWhen Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman honoured the 50th anniversary of the Byrds’ 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo by touring it for the first time, there was only one man who could lead their backing band: Marty Stuart. When Ken Burns began filming 2019’s Country Music documentary series, it was Stuart who guided the director through the genre. From Porter Wagoner to Johnny Cash, many Nashville icons have called on Stuart to play with them. Stuart is country’s ruling polymath – a musician whose skill on guitar and mandolin is matched by his encyclopaedic knowledge and vast enthusiasm.If you only go to one country music concert, then let it be Marty Stuart’s – he’s about to tour the UK for the first time in five years, so the opportunity awaits. “I like playing the UK,” says Stuart. “First of all, I think there is an appreciation for authentic country music over there that sometimes gets lost in America.

I discover this when I’m asked to freestyle a few verses on a visit to London’s Abbey Road recording studios. Immediately lines from famous rappers flood into my head – some classic Biggie, a few Young Thug yelps, the theme to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air – but I’ve got to think up something original.Out of desperation, I decide to rap about my morning routine. Adopting a slow pace and simple rhyme scheme that even the Sugarhill Gang would disdain, I begin: “I wake up at seven and I brush my teeth.” Already I am at a loss. What rhymes with “teeth”? Panicking, I look at the computer in front of me, which is running a demo of iRap, AI software built to assist lyric writing in real time. It has been transcribing my words and offers possible rhymes I might want to use: “heath, sheath, underneath”. Could that work? “Make a bacon sandwich, put some cheese underneath,” I sigh.

Every other lyric dictates the pros of necrophilia, every other frontman screeches in cheap corpse paint and every other band logo is as legible as tea leaves. The exceptions, however, are on show at ArcTanGent, which has returned to Fernhill farm after a Covid-warranted hiatus to showcase the best of loud yet convention-shattering music. A reputation for quality bookings has seen the three-day event grow to five stages and a capacity of 10,000 in less than a decade, and the 2022 edition accompanies that growing scope with the best lineup yet.Fes make for a vibrant start on Thursday. The math-rockers prove intellectual tunes needn’t skimp on a good pop hook, as frontperson Pollyanna Holland-Wing sings while playing guitar like a virtuoso. A sombre counterweight comes from instrumentalists Pijn, who accentuate their devastation with sorrowful violins. They’re the first of a legion of post-metal bands to decimate this weekend. The genre shines brightest – ironically – with the hellish density of Thursday headliners Cult of Luna. The sextet could be the world’s heaviest band, and hearing behemoth songs such as Blood Upon Stone blast out of fog thicker than John Carpenter could conjure up affirms that idea. It’s the apex of the festival, their closest rivals being Amenra. The Belgians are an existential crisis in sonic form, casting dread-laden post-metal against panicked shrieks to curate the most perfect kind of horrible.

It’s Coldplay’s latest, family-friendly attempt at global dominationOh, to have been a fly on the wall at the production meetings for Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres tour, currently winding up a run of six sold-out nights at London’s Wembley stadium. Umpteen stakeholders would have pondered the tour’s environmental aspects in the wake of Coldplay’s 2019 announcement that they would stop touring while they worked out how to make it less worse for the planet.Sceptics should note that the band’s light-up wristbands, always magical, are now made of compostable plastic. Anyone with any passing knowledge of Coldplay gigs knows that the play of the colour across the venue, like a murmuration of starlings, is one of the greatest spectacles in stadium showmanship. The floor is wired to harness the kinetic energy of 90,000 bouncing souls. If only they could wire up Chris Martin himself, who exudes gigawatts of energy running around, belting out the hits. The band reportedly ferry stuff around using as little carbon as possible – although if any act could pull off a fleet of Phileas Fogg-style solar-powered hot-air zeppelins, it’s this one, with their Tiggerish optimism and penchant for unleashing brightly coloured balloons.

As a teenager she performed in metal bands, moshed at gigs, went to UK bass music and dubstep nights and danced to hefty sound systems.

Squeezing her “Christmas bubble” of friends into her living room, Iceland’s most famous citizen was throwing another of her “crazy DJ nights, where 20 people could come and I always ended up DJing just gabber”.According to Björk, the nails-hard 90s Dutch techno style is the perfect soundtrack to Covid life. “There’s always a BPM in our bodies, you know? And I think through Covid we were all pretty lazy, just sitting home reading books, so when we got drunk or partied it was like we went a little bit mental, then we just fell asleep before midnight.

Now he’s ready to see if people want to hear the guy behind the gagsWhen he was “around 14”, Bret McKenzie became obsessed with the Leonard Cohen album I’m Your Man. Its synth-heavy tales of geopolitics, romantic devotion and the poems of Federico García Lorca made it an unusual choice for a pubescent boy in suburban New Zealand. Nevertheless, at school, he and his friends would happily sing along to tracks such as Jazz Police and First We Take Manhattan when passing between lessons.As they sang, McKenzie listened to the voices of his peers, plumbing Cohen’s baritone depths. Meanwhile his own, still unbroken, squeaked along beside them. Even then, he saw the comedy in this collision: the autumnal wit of the lyrics, the juvenile scratch of the voice. It instilled in him a new sense of how songs could be: “Serious, but also strange, and funny in a weird way,” is how he describes it. “I think that’s always stuck with me.” Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/20/bret-mckenzie-flight-of-the-conchords-interview-songs-without-jokes","2430","ENTERTAINMENT"

It meant that our throats got larger, which enabled us to extend the sounds we could make beyond animalistic hooting and howling. Suddenly, we could talk. We could develop a vocabulary. We could sing.This development marked the birth of music, yet we really know only about relatively recent developments in that enormous history. The world’s oldest known musical instrument – a Neanderthal flute carved from the bone of a bear, found in 1995 in a Slovenian cave – is just 50,000 years old.

Last year they released their debut album, Nafs at Peace, which consisted of electronically inflected ragas.

This is the Houston rapper’s first big headline performance since 2021’s Astroworld festival – an event founded by Scott – where a fatal crowd crush resulted in the accidental deaths of 10 people and hundreds of injuries.

"2669","Aitch: Close to Home review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week","1660820444000","(Capitol)Referencing the Stone Roses and featuring Shaun Ryder, the Manchester rapper’s debut album stops short of a second coming – but it pushes his musical boundaries and subverts traditional hip-hop narrativesAt the time of writing, the face of Harrison Armstrong – better known as Aitch – stares down from bus shelters around Britain advertising Lynx deodorant. You can snigger at this development if you like – it’s hardly Jay-Z endorsing luxury Swiss watches – but it’s worth noting that not every multi-platinum US rapper deals exclusively in high-end products: as well as promoting Balenciaga, Megan Thee Stallion recently recorded a track shilling Cheetos, the American equivalent of becoming the glamorous face of Wotsits. Moreover, it tells you something about the spread of UK rap and the position Armstrong currently occupies in British youth culture: there was a time, before Skepta and Stormzy, when a rapper with a Mancunian accent would have got no further than a tiny local label. Today, if you want to reach a big market of odiferous adolescent boys, Aitch, with a string of Top 10 hits to his name – five of them platinum sellers – is very much your guy.A man who last year did a photoshoot in the former headquarters of Factory Records, Aitch has described his debut album Close to Home as “100,000% a proper Manchester album”. A rumoured collaboration with Liam Gallagher is nowhere to be seen, but Shaun Ryder’s voice booms out between tracks (as does that of Aitch’s dad, calling him “a knobhead” for failing to provide receipts for his expenses). His song 1989 samples the Stone Roses’ Fools Gold and pays homage to Madchester’s annus mirabilis in its title, if not its lyrics. The special edition vinyl cover is by Matt Carroll of Central Station Design, the company best known for designing the Happy Mondays’ album sleeves, who has been quick to place Aitch in a lineage of “great wordsmiths from Manchester’s past” – including not just Ryder, but John Cooper Clarke. Those comparisons are pushing it a bit. (And perhaps not helped by his team accidentally destroying a beloved local Ian Curtis mural.) You could just about make a case for a similarity between Aitch’s nasal delivery and that of Cooper Clarke, though there’s none of Ryder’s drugged-out surrealism about his lyrical approach. But Aitch’s lyrics are definitely at their most striking when they abandon the standard-issue stuff about trapping in the bandos to root themselves in his home town, whether hymning family ties on R Kid or mistily recalling a youth spent “smoking in the alley and buying singles from a shabby gaff”. “Back then I had to Rusholme if you grew up in Moston,” he recalls in a neat bit of wordplay on Money Habits.

"2670","The Mountain Goats: Bleed Out review – a concept album that leads with bloody revenge","1660894209000","(Merge)Shot through with pop-culture references, this 21st album from the indie rockers is brilliantly executed but offers limited emotional depthOne might think of John Darnielle as a more emotionally and musically forgiving counterpart to Mark E Smith: determinedly following his own prolific path, and if it’s him and your granny on bongos, it’s still the Mountain Goats. On his 21st official album he’s in the concept game again. Previous records have been inspired by role-playing games and an adolescence of listening to goth bands; now Bleed Out takes its lead from the bloody revenges exacted by the protagonists of action movies, set to indie rock that veers from folky to near metal in Wage Wars Get Rich Die Handsome.It’s not a novelty record – Darnielle has said he is fascinated by the fact that revenge seems so appealing precisely because it’s unavailable to those who don’t live in action movies – but it’s shot through with pop-culture references, and images that are familiar to anyone who watches movies in which gun-toting men pursue their nemeses. Training Montage’s title is utterly on the nose: it describes the set-up everyone has seen a thousand times. Cliches are nailed throughout the album, down to men who “have loosely gathered / To stand in doorways / Making small talk / About the weather”, in Guys on Every Corner.

"2671","Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith: Let’s Turn It Into Sound review | John Lewis's contemporary album of the month","1660896009000","(Ghostly International)While tracks frequently change tempo, key and mood, and discordant elements overlap, occasionally the cacophony sounds sublimeThere’s often a whiff of joss sticks surrounding the music of Los Angeles-based composer Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith. In the past she has made an LP of drones for yoga and meditation, a new age album that was premiered on the Calm app, and she’s even written a pocketbook called Listening (complete with cards featuring “listening exercises”).But Smith is also a leading figure in modular synthesis. She studied composition and sound engineering at Berklee College of Music, falling under the spell of Steve Reich, and later acquired an enormous Buchla synthesiser, using it to make several solo albums of burbling electronica. She has also made a synth-pop concept album about the life cycle, recorded a duet with her mentor Suzanne Ciani and another collaboration with Hollywood composer Emile Mosseri.

"2672","The Chats: Get Fucked review – Brisbane’s reprobate punks trade novelty for longevity","1660939221000","They may never recapture the naive charm of their viral debut – but the playing is tighter, the music tougher, and the songs still crackle with energyGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailLet’s start with the title. The Chats don’t care what you think, and even less (I hope) what the Guardian thinks. This band did not care what Karl Stefanovic thought when they ran around the set of the Today show. And nor should they, as a reprobate punk band from Pig City, AKA Brisbane (via the Sunshine Coast).That said, there are some signs of growing pains on Get Fucked, the follow-up to 2020’s High Risk Behaviour. In some ways, this album is to the Chats what Leave Home was to Ramones: it’s tighter, with better playing and a tougher sound, but lacks some of the naive charm that made their debut so endearing. They have also lost guitarist Josh Price, and he takes a little of the Chats’ humour with him.

"2673","Watkins Family Hour: Vol II review – a great night out with ringside seats","1661007643000","(Family Hour)US siblings Sara and Sean Watkins are joined by Fiona Apple, Jackson Browne and more on another set of old classics and new favourites in Nashville formIt takes a special chemistry for any residency to endure for 20 years. As much shines through this celebration of the monthly get-together hosted by the sibling duo Sara and Sean Watkins at LA’s Largo nightspot. As co-founders of the hugely successful (and innovative) bluegrass band Nickel Creek, since 2002 the Watkinses have attracted a stellar roster of friends and fellow travellers to revive yesteryear classics and garb new favourites in Nashville clothing.So it goes with this second studio gathering (the first was in 2015), which opens with The Way I Feel Inside, a 1965 song by Brit moptops the Zombies, recast with the help of New York indie outfit Lucius. More radical is the way (Remember Me) I’m the One Who Loves You, a chunk of loungecore schlock by Dean Martin, becomes a honky-tonk hoedown voiced by Fiona Apple. The late country pioneer Ernest Tubb is hauled into an R&amp;B version of Thanks a Lot by “Largo mascot” Jon Brion, while Willie Watson and Jackson Browne are among other notable contributors. Underpinning everything are the Watkinses themselves, especially the agile vocals of Sara, who outshines California art rockers Tune-Yards on a cover of their Hypnotized. But it’s not a competition, just a great night out with a ringside seat.

"2674","Aitch: Close to Home review – staking his claim to the mainstream","1661083208000","(EMI)The sugar rushes are tempered by vulnerable, darker notes on the Manchester rapper’s hotly anticipated debutThe 22-year-old Manchester rapper Harrison Armstrong, AKA Aitch, has had a meteoric rise. His breakout, tongue-twisting 2018 track Straight Rhymez brought him to the attention of Stormzy, and singles Taste (Make It Shake) and Rain both reached the UK Top 10. Fresh-faced, with a cheeky grin, Armstrong gave voice to teen innuendoes while toting the gold chains of success.His debut album has been much anticipated. Boasting features from Ed Sheeran and AJ Tracey, these 16 tracks are Armstrong staking his claim to the mainstream. The results are largely predictable: singles 1989 and Baby interpolate samples from Ashanti’s 2003 hit Rock Wit U and Stone Roses anthem Fools Gold, with Armstrong’s verses as embellishment. Original production In Disguise plays like a pastiche of the Streets.

"2675","Cass McCombs: Heartmind review – knotty nuance bathed in melodic succour","1661068803000","(Anti-)The turbulent, everyday lives of others populate the California singer-songwriter’s masterly new albumWhose emotions are these, anyway? Cass McCombs’s 10th album is an easy, rolling record that grapples with inner complexity, telling stories about musicians and soldiers, lovers and seekers. Even as this seasoned US singer-songwriter butts up against philosophical quandaries or quotes from Sufism, he never loses track of the everyday. When he isn’t making singular records, McCombs has worked in demolition and crashed on couches; his is a landscape of fast-food restaurants and karaoke machines, where vans break down, people make mistakes and die too soon.A gentle, psychedelic wash glazes this set of songs whose musical erudition is worn lightly. The album’s opener, Music Is Blue, is a masterclass in how to wring effortless prettiness out of progressive time signatures and jazz drums. The lovely Karaoke is a lovelorn Teenage Fanclub shuffle that wonders whether we all just perform secondhand emotions, where McCombs questions a relationship quoting everything from Unchained Melody to Stand By Your Man. The exceptional Unproud Warrior, by contrast, spins the tale of a soldier returned from war, living with the consequences of choices he has made; the question of his culpability is greyed out magnificently.

"2676","Demi Lovato: Holy Fvck review – finally having fun","1661090410000","(Island)The US singer-songwriter shifts tack from last year’s trauma-led Dancing With the Devil, tapping into the pop-punk of her youthful debut“Am I the only one looking for substance?” sings Demi Lovato on her new single – to which the answer is, obviously, no. But her search for “substance” takes on a sharply different tone given that Lovato recovered from a near-fatal overdose in 2018, preceded by addiction, an eating disorder and being raped as a teenager. The experiences were chronicled in 2021’s Dancing With the Devil album and documentary – although the music stuck to an oddly tasteful pop palette. Holy Fvck signals a genuine shift. In the past year, Lovato has come out as non-binary, launched a sex toy and gone UFO-hunting in the desert; in short, it sounds like she’s finally having fun. The album harks back to the pop-punk sounds of her 2008 debut, Don’t Forget, with Skin of My Teeth pitched somewhere between McFly and Foo Fighters. But there are some thrillingly dark moments too, as on Eat Me (ft Royal &amp; the Serpent), with its industrial grind, tempo shifts and raging yelps, and the pleasingly lusty Bones. Holy Fvck has its flaws – Lovato’s powerful voice is unnecessarily finessed and Auto-Tuned, and 16 tracks is too long. But its gutsy ambition is a thing of substance in and of itself.

"2677","Darius Campbell Danesh: an alluring mix of naivety, panache and genuine talent","1660723270000","His journey from tryer to survivor to established success story is unlike anything else seen in TV talent show historyIn the embryonic days of UK TV talent shows, Darius Campbell Danesh – whose death at the age of 41 was announced on Tuesday – did two genuinely revolutionary things. Firstly, he succeeded in making a song his own – the holy grail of TV talent shows – via his gloriously OTT rendition of Britney Spears’ Baby One More Time on Popstars in 2001. Dressed somewhere between a roll-necked Steve Jobs and a swashbuckling musketeer, he became the instant star of a show that spectacularly failed in its remit to create stars.For his second trick, he re-emerged later that year looking like a matinee idol and singing like Elvis to finish third on Pop Idol and later land himself a UK No 1 single with Colourblind. Reality TV is all about narratives and often they can build up around people and solidify like cement; somehow, via an alluring mix of naivety, panache and genuine talent, Darius was able to rewrite his.

While that transformation may apply to her most famous role as Sandy in the musical Grease, it does a disservice to how ably – and convincingly – the chameleonic British-Australian musician shape-shifted between genres and rode the changing moods of pop to become one of the biggest hit-makers of her era and an enduring cult icon.Newton-John broke out at the beginning of the 1970s as a country-pop singer, with single If Not For You, a Bob Dylan cover, becoming an unexpected hit in North America. She cemented her reputation in the genre with the assertive, Grammy-winning Let Me Be There, her first US Top 10 hit, the ballad I Honestly Love You and the plaintive Please Mr Please, which reached No 3 in the US pop charts, No 5 in its country charts and No 1 in easy listening. By 1974, she had been named female vocalist of the year by the Country Music Association, and not without controversy – Newton-John beat Nashville royalty such as Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to the prize, which prompted an industry protest.

Crowdfunded by our dance music community and industry, this self-published book features 150 real-life stories of pivotal women from all walks of the scene, including many DJs, who are true pioneers. It was because of their input that we have the culture we have today. Women weren’t being documented truthfully for their contributions. Lady of the House is advocating to ensure women who work in dance music get the recognition they deserve, stepping up into a broader initiative, which is well respected for celebrating, championing and honouring women in dance music, and which has included the creation of an exhibition, participation in global conferences, club shows and festivals, and the recent launch of a record label. As a brown woman from a low socio-economic background who has worked in dance music for 20 years, I often wonder what people like me have to do to be acknowledged. Regardless of receiving that recognition or not, we will continue at the front and centre in the push for fair representation.Laila MckenzieCo-author, Lady of the House Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/23/pioneering-female-djs-deserve-recognition-for-their-contribution-to-club-culture","2452","ENTERTAINMENT"

Nestled in the natural amphitheatre of a Welsh mountain valley, for two decades the festival has offered a suspension of reality that its annually returning devotees can only describe as “magic”. Where else can you find refuge from a festival’s never-ending spectacles to hold a chicken?In these intervening years, Green Man has fostered a certain intimacy with its audience, meaning the 25,000 tickets for its 20th-anniversary weekender sold out within three days despite the only confirmed headliner being Mercury-prize winner Michael Kiwanuka. But Green Man dares to roll the dice while remaining deserving of this blind faith.
