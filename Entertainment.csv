The floor is wired to harness the kinetic energy of 90,000 bouncing souls. If only they could wire up Chris Martin himself, who exudes gigawatts of energy running around, belting out the hits. The band reportedly ferry stuff around using as little carbon as possible – although if any act could pull off a fleet of Phileas Fogg-style solar-powered hot-air zeppelins, it’s this one, with their Tiggerish optimism and penchant for unleashing brightly coloured balloons. The giant beach balls come out on Adventure of a Lifetime, two songs into this generous, career-spanning set – one that baffles as much as it dazzles.

Now he’s ready to see if people want to hear the guy behind the gagsWhen he was “around 14”, Bret McKenzie became obsessed with the Leonard Cohen album I’m Your Man. Its synth-heavy tales of geopolitics, romantic devotion and the poems of Federico García Lorca made it an unusual choice for a pubescent boy in suburban New Zealand. Nevertheless, at school, he and his friends would happily sing along to tracks such as Jazz Police and First We Take Manhattan when passing between lessons.As they sang, McKenzie listened to the voices of his peers, plumbing Cohen’s baritone depths. Meanwhile his own, still unbroken, squeaked along beside them. Even then, he saw the comedy in this collision: the autumnal wit of the lyrics, the juvenile scratch of the voice. It instilled in him a new sense of how songs could be: “Serious, but also strange, and funny in a weird way,” is how he describes it. “I think that’s always stuck with me.” Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/20/bret-mckenzie-flight-of-the-conchords-interview-songs-without-jokes"

Squeezing her “Christmas bubble” of friends into her living room, Iceland’s most famous citizen was throwing another of her “crazy DJ nights, where 20 people could come and I always ended up DJing just gabber”.According to Björk, the nails-hard 90s Dutch techno style is the perfect soundtrack to Covid life. “There’s always a BPM in our bodies, you know? And I think through Covid we were all pretty lazy, just sitting home reading books, so when we got drunk or partied it was like we went a little bit mental, then we just fell asleep before midnight. Slow energy, but then it goes double.” And that, she realised, is “a little bit gabber”.

How many of our venues can survive this?Imagine a small music venue. There are many such places dotted around the UK, the sort of spot where you might catch an up-and-coming band, some folk or jazz, the occasional standup comedian. I’m thinking of a real venue, capacity 500, in the south of England. There’s nowhere else to see live music in this town, and it’s been going for decades. Only it may not be around for much longer. It’s just had its electricity bill, from the largely state-owned French company EDF (fill in your own ironies). That bill is 640% higher than the last one.There’s no energy price cap for businesses such as this – that’s just for households. They’ve pulled in a broker to try to get them a better rate, without success. The extra £31,000 for putting the lights on is more than what the boss is paid.

The majority of the Jamaican immigrants who came to the UK in the 50s settled there – my own grandparents plumped for Stevenage, just north of the city.

This is the Houston rapper’s first big headline performance since 2021’s Astroworld festival – an event founded by Scott – where a fatal crowd crush resulted in the accidental deaths of 10 people and hundreds of injuries. It’s clear the incident affected him. During a supporting slot for Meek Mill in New York earlier this year, Scott stopped mid-show when an audience member climbed up on the lighting rig. It was a striking moment, because even a year ago, he might not have called out this kind of behaviour.Sometimes known as La Flame, the rapper is very excited tonight: he shouts out his daughter, Stormy, and runs around the stage, limbs flailing in zigzags, every now and again flopping his body down with his arms grazing the ground, like a tired robot (an image enhanced by his aesthetic choices: he wears a futuristic-looking pair of white goggles with tiny slits).

Festival co-founder Peter Gabriel is here, of course, introducing Ghanaian-British rock band Osibisa, praising their role in popularising African music here back in the 70s, and harking back to the first Womad in 1982, when their singer and dancer Angie Anderson was also with the dance company Ekome, who backed Gabriel on his performance of Biko. The Congolese soukous veteran Kanda Bongo Man, still as rousing a performer as ever, said that his UK debut at Womad in 1983 “took me from nowhere to the international market”. And those passionate exponents of Sufi devotional singing, the Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali, paid tribute to their uncle Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, whose 1985 Womad debut also received praise from Gabriel in an earlier onstage discussion of the festival’s history.But the festival also continues to look to the future and trails still being blazed. Sona Jobarteh, the continent’s first female kora-playing star, demonstrates her exquisite playing of the West African harp alongside a band that includes her 15-year-old son Sidiki on balafon. From Europe come Taraf de Caliu, four of whom were once international stars with Romanian Gypsy band Taraf de Haïdouks. They returned to Clejani, Romania after the band split and – fronted by new singer Florin Murgoi, who said he was a farmer in the village until they signed him up – they’re clearly delighted to be back with their thrilling, virtuoso blend of rapid-fire duelling violins and cimbalom.

You can snigger at this development if you like – it’s hardly Jay-Z endorsing luxury Swiss watches – but it’s worth noting that not every multi-platinum US rapper deals exclusively in high-end products: as well as promoting Balenciaga, Megan Thee Stallion recently recorded a track shilling Cheetos, the American equivalent of becoming the glamorous face of Wotsits. Moreover, it tells you something about the spread of UK rap and the position Armstrong currently occupies in British youth culture: there was a time, before Skepta and Stormzy, when a rapper with a Mancunian accent would have got no further than a tiny local label. Today, if you want to reach a big market of odiferous adolescent boys, Aitch, with a string of Top 10 hits to his name – five of them platinum sellers – is very much your guy.A man who last year did a photoshoot in the former headquarters of Factory Records, Aitch has described his debut album Close to Home as “100,000% a proper Manchester album”. A rumoured collaboration with Liam Gallagher is nowhere to be seen, but Shaun Ryder’s voice booms out between tracks (as does that of Aitch’s dad, calling him “a knobhead” for failing to provide receipts for his expenses). His song 1989 samples the Stone Roses’ Fools Gold and pays homage to Madchester’s annus mirabilis in its title, if not its lyrics. The special edition vinyl cover is by Matt Carroll of Central Station Design, the company best known for designing the Happy Mondays’ album sleeves, who has been quick to place Aitch in a lineage of “great wordsmiths from Manchester’s past” – including not just Ryder, but John Cooper Clarke. Those comparisons are pushing it a bit. (And perhaps not helped by his team accidentally destroying a beloved local Ian Curtis mural.) You could just about make a case for a similarity between Aitch’s nasal delivery and that of Cooper Clarke, though there’s none of Ryder’s drugged-out surrealism about his lyrical approach. But Aitch’s lyrics are definitely at their most striking when they abandon the standard-issue stuff about trapping in the bandos to root themselves in his home town, whether hymning family ties on R Kid or mistily recalling a youth spent “smoking in the alley and buying singles from a shabby gaff”. “Back then I had to Rusholme if you grew up in Moston,” he recalls in a neat bit of wordplay on Money Habits.

As much shines through this celebration of the monthly get-together hosted by the sibling duo Sara and Sean Watkins at LA’s Largo nightspot. As co-founders of the hugely successful (and innovative) bluegrass band Nickel Creek, since 2002 the Watkinses have attracted a stellar roster of friends and fellow travellers to revive yesteryear classics and garb new favourites in Nashville clothing.So it goes with this second studio gathering (the first was in 2015), which opens with The Way I Feel Inside, a 1965 song by Brit moptops the Zombies, recast with the help of New York indie outfit Lucius. More radical is the way (Remember Me) I’m the One Who Loves You, a chunk of loungecore schlock by Dean Martin, becomes a honky-tonk hoedown voiced by Fiona Apple. The late country pioneer Ernest Tubb is hauled into an R&amp;B version of Thanks a Lot by “Largo mascot” Jon Brion, while Willie Watson and Jackson Browne are among other notable contributors.

His breakout, tongue-twisting 2018 track Straight Rhymez brought him to the attention of Stormzy, and singles Taste (Make It Shake) and Rain both reached the UK Top 10.

Boasting features from Ed Sheeran and AJ Tracey, these 16 tracks are Armstrong staking his claim to the mainstream.

Cass McCombs’s 10th album is an easy, rolling record that grapples with inner complexity, telling stories about musicians and soldiers, lovers and seekers. Even as this seasoned US singer-songwriter butts up against philosophical quandaries or quotes from Sufism, he never loses track of the everyday. When he isn’t making singular records, McCombs has worked in demolition and crashed on couches; his is a landscape of fast-food restaurants and karaoke machines, where vans break down, people make mistakes and die too soon.A gentle, psychedelic wash glazes this set of songs whose musical erudition is worn lightly. The album’s opener, Music Is Blue, is a masterclass in how to wring effortless prettiness out of progressive time signatures and jazz drums. The lovely Karaoke is a lovelorn Teenage Fanclub shuffle that wonders whether we all just perform secondhand emotions, where McCombs questions a relationship quoting everything from Unchained Melody to Stand By Your Man. The exceptional Unproud Warrior, by contrast, spins the tale of a soldier returned from war, living with the consequences of choices he has made; the question of his culpability is greyed out magnificently.

But her search for “substance” takes on a sharply different tone given that Lovato recovered from a near-fatal overdose in 2018, preceded by addiction, an eating disorder and being raped as a teenager. The experiences were chronicled in 2021’s Dancing With the Devil album and documentary – although the music stuck to an oddly tasteful pop palette. Holy Fvck signals a genuine shift. In the past year, Lovato has come out as non-binary, launched a sex toy and gone UFO-hunting in the desert; in short, it sounds like she’s finally having fun. The album harks back to the pop-punk sounds of her 2008 debut, Don’t Forget, with Skin of My Teeth pitched somewhere between McFly and Foo Fighters. But there are some thrillingly dark moments too, as on Eat Me (ft Royal &amp; the Serpent), with its industrial grind, tempo shifts and raging yelps, and the pleasingly lusty Bones.

"86","Megan Thee Stallion: Traumazine review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week","1660283840000","(300 Records)The Texan rapper comes out swinging on her latest release – slinging a seemingly limitless supply of fantastic insults at the industry and countless nameless foesReleased amid a hail of controversy – some of it stemming from an incident in which its author was shot, allegedly by rapper Tory Lanez – Megan Thee Stallion’s 2020 debut album Good News was an exercise in optimism from its title down. Two years on, there’s more controversy – the Texan rapper is currently engaged in a bitter legal battle with her record label – but her mood has clearly changed. The title of Good News’ follow-up is derived from “a chemical released in the brain when it is forced to deal with painful emotions caused by traumatic events”; the video announcing its release featured a funeral, gatecrashed by Megan Thee Stallion in an absolutely enormous hat. “I’m on my fuck-you shit, bitch, I’m done being nice,” she announces a few minutes after Traumazine begins.You can say that again: there are fleeting and very occasional references to wider current events, including Roe v Wade – “my body, my motherfucking choice,” she snaps on Gift and a Curse – but Traumazine largely sticks to the topic of what she calls “fake-ass, snake-ass, backstabbing, hatin’-ass, no money, kidding-ass bitches”. Suitably riled, she comes out swinging to such a degree that even the rhymes about sex feel strangely confrontational and pugilistic. Red Wine has her “looking at your pretty face while I’m straddling it”: her delivery makes it sound as if she’s describing murdering someone, rather than showing them a good time.

"87","Danger Mouse and Black Thought: Cheat Codes review – an out-and-out hip-hop masterpiece","1660395641000","(BMG)Razor-sharp US rapper Black Thought and his one-time acolyte, now super-producer, Danger Mouse, finally get it together on an album that’s a nonstop joyCheat Codes, the long-awaited collaboration between US super-producer Danger Mouse and Philadelphia hip-hop institution Black Thought, is an out-and-out pleasure, one chock-full of old-school hip-hop goodness. No Gold Teeth, for instance, has a funk bassline so gummy you could chew it contentedly like cud for hours, with Black Thought, one of the most erudite wordsmiths of his generation, riding the beat like a dancer. “Please, you ain’t fuckin’ with no amateurs, homie,” he sneers, correct on that count as he is on numerous others here: razor-sharp takedowns of racial injustice and masterful braggadocio. No filler, all killer, once on, you’ll have trouble peeling Cheat Codes off the turntable or, indeed, Spotify.But this banging summer album also comes with an unrequited mutual appreciation bromance subplot. In 2006, a white-hot young hip-hop producer in deep legal trouble with a major label met his rapper hero, only a few years his senior. When Danger Mouse – Brian Burton – was still in high school, he paid a friend to steal the Roots’ second album, Do You Want More ?!!!??! (1995), for less than the inflated CD price (though this wasn’t the source of his later legal headaches). When they finally met, the Roots’ Black Thought (Tariq Trotter) and his acolyte hit it off. The two thought they might make a record. Dangerous Thoughts was mooted as a title.

"88","Star Feminine Band: In Paris review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month","1660291207000","(Born Bad Records)The prodigious performers from Benin showcase their astounding pace of musical development, having only picked up their instruments for the first time in 2016Benin’s Star Feminine Band have had a remarkable journey to releasing their music. The seven-piece all-female group, aged between 12 and 19, only began learning their instruments in 2016, after participating in a free music workshop in their remote home town of Natitingou. Following two years of after-school rehearsals, the group came to the attention of French engineer Jérémie Verdier, who recorded demos of the band’s celebratory mix of Ghanaian highlife melody, earthy Congolese rumba and folk sato rhythms.Those tapes made their way to Parisian label Born Bad Records and in 2020 the band debuted with a self-titled album. Confronting their status as one of the only groups in Benin to feature women playing instruments, they produced songs such as Peba and Femme Africaine, which advocated for their place in society.

"89","Darius Campbell Danesh: an alluring mix of naivety, panache and genuine talent","1660723270000","His journey from tryer to survivor to established success story is unlike anything else seen in TV talent show historyIn the embryonic days of UK TV talent shows, Darius Campbell Danesh – whose death at the age of 41 was announced on Tuesday – did two genuinely revolutionary things. Firstly, he succeeded in making a song his own – the holy grail of TV talent shows – via his gloriously OTT rendition of Britney Spears’ Baby One More Time on Popstars in 2001. Dressed somewhere between a roll-necked Steve Jobs and a swashbuckling musketeer, he became the instant star of a show that spectacularly failed in its remit to create stars.For his second trick, he re-emerged later that year looking like a matinee idol and singing like Elvis to finish third on Pop Idol and later land himself a UK No 1 single with Colourblind. Reality TV is all about narratives and often they can build up around people and solidify like cement; somehow, via an alluring mix of naivety, panache and genuine talent, Darius was able to rewrite his.

While that transformation may apply to her most famous role as Sandy in the musical Grease, it does a disservice to how ably – and convincingly – the chameleonic British-Australian musician shape-shifted between genres and rode the changing moods of pop to become one of the biggest hit-makers of her era and an enduring cult icon.Newton-John broke out at the beginning of the 1970s as a country-pop singer, with single If Not For You, a Bob Dylan cover, becoming an unexpected hit in North America. She cemented her reputation in the genre with the assertive, Grammy-winning Let Me Be There, her first US Top 10 hit, the ballad I Honestly Love You and the plaintive Please Mr Please, which reached No 3 in the US pop charts, No 5 in its country charts and No 1 in easy listening. By 1974, she had been named female vocalist of the year by the Country Music Association, and not without controversy – Newton-John beat Nashville royalty such as Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to the prize, which prompted an industry protest.

"96","The Mountain Goats: Bleed Out review – a concept album that leads with bloody revenge","1660894209000","(Merge)Shot through with pop-culture references, this 21st album from the indie rockers is brilliantly executed but offers limited emotional depthOne might think of John Darnielle as a more emotionally and musically forgiving counterpart to Mark E Smith: determinedly following his own prolific path, and if it’s him and your granny on bongos, it’s still the Mountain Goats. On his 21st official album he’s in the concept game again. Previous records have been inspired by role-playing games and an adolescence of listening to goth bands; now Bleed Out takes its lead from the bloody revenges exacted by the protagonists of action movies, set to indie rock that veers from folky to near metal in Wage Wars Get Rich Die Handsome.It’s not a novelty record – Darnielle has said he is fascinated by the fact that revenge seems so appealing precisely because it’s unavailable to those who don’t live in action movies – but it’s shot through with pop-culture references, and images that are familiar to anyone who watches movies in which gun-toting men pursue their nemeses. Training Montage’s title is utterly on the nose: it describes the set-up everyone has seen a thousand times. Cliches are nailed throughout the album, down to men who “have loosely gathered / To stand in doorways / Making small talk / About the weather”, in Guys on Every Corner.

Her vocals teem with emotion over dense instrumentals that reverberate with an undercurrent of darkness. She cites Sarah Vaughan and the Iranian Dutch songwriter Sevdaliza as influences, but it’s telling that the British Jamaican artist also loves the US rock band Tool.Agaama grew up listening to her parents’ classical and jazz records while forming her own bond to heavier sounds. She learned to sing at theatre school and later picked up trombone. As a teenager she performed in metal bands, moshed at gigs, went to UK bass music and dubstep nights and danced to hefty sound systems. Her 2020 debut EP, Safe in Noise, felt straightforwardly indebted to jazz and classical, with affecting choral harmonies and deft horn arrangements, albeit with nods to a slightly off-kilter soundworld.
