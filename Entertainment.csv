"69","Aitch: Close to Home review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week","1660820444000","(Capitol)Referencing the Stone Roses and featuring Shaun Ryder, the Manchester rapper’s debut album stops short of a second coming – but it pushes his musical boundaries and subverts traditional hip-hop narrativesAt the time of writing, the face of Harrison Armstrong – better known as Aitch – stares down from bus shelters around Britain advertising Lynx deodorant. You can snigger at this development if you like – it’s hardly Jay-Z endorsing luxury Swiss watches – but it’s worth noting that not every multi-platinum US rapper deals exclusively in high-end products: as well as promoting Balenciaga, Megan Thee Stallion recently recorded a track shilling Cheetos, the American equivalent of becoming the glamorous face of Wotsits. Moreover, it tells you something about the spread of UK rap and the position Armstrong currently occupies in British youth culture: there was a time, before Skepta and Stormzy, when a rapper with a Mancunian accent would have got no further than a tiny local label. Today, if you want to reach a big market of odiferous adolescent boys, Aitch, with a string of Top 10 hits to his name – five of them platinum sellers – is very much your guy.A man who last year did a photoshoot in the former headquarters of Factory Records, Aitch has described his debut album Close to Home as “100,000% a proper Manchester album”. A rumoured collaboration with Liam Gallagher is nowhere to be seen, but Shaun Ryder’s voice booms out between tracks (as does that of one of Aitch’s management team, calling him “a knobhead” for failing to provide receipts for his expenses). His song 1989 samples the Stone Roses’ Fools Gold and pays homage to Madchester’s annus mirabilis in its title, if not its lyrics. The cover is by Matt Carroll of Central Station Design, the company best known for designing the Happy Mondays’ album sleeves, who has been quick to place Aitch in a lineage of “great wordsmiths from Manchester’s past” – including not just Ryder, but John Cooper Clarke. Those comparisons are pushing it a bit: you could just about make a case for a similarity between Aitch’s nasal delivery and that of Cooper Clarke, though there’s none of Ryder’s drugged-out surrealism about his lyrical approach. But Aitch’s lyrics are definitely at their most striking when they abandon the standard-issue stuff about trapping in the bandos to root themselves in his home town, whether hymning family ties on R Kid or mistily recalling a youth spent “smoking in the alley and buying singles from a shabby gaff”. “Back then I had to Rusholme if you grew up in Moston,” he recalls in a neat bit of wordplay on Money Habits.

But you should see the ‘bandwiches’ they get offered to eat | Jay Rayner","1660820444000","Musicians know all about the gig economy – and the grim food that goes with it. He who pays the piper should feed them properly too The online world can be a scary place. For me, one of the internet’s most dismaying corners is a members-only forum on Facebook called Bandwiches. It’s a portmanteau word, the crashing together of “band” and “sandwiches”, coined by the saxophonist Stan Harrison after a particularly dismal experience. It celebrates or, to be more exact, bemoans the grim quality of so much of the food offered to musicians on gigs in UK hospitality settings. Here are numerous shots of terrible, cold mini sausage rolls the colour of yesterday’s porridge. There’s a meagre plate of biscuits alongside some orange juice with a handwritten note saying: “Out of date. Help yourself at your own peril.” There are polystyrene boxes filled with a tiny number of indeterminate deep-fried things. And, of course, lots and lots of terrible, floppy sandwiches made with the pappiest of pappy white bread. It’s all so damn beige. And the portions! So small!This could be dismissed as the nichest of niche problems. Then again, the Bandwiches Facebook group has 4,300 members. That’s a significant slab of the UK’s gigging musicians. And even if it is a side issue, it’s my side issue. I am both a jazz musician and a journalist who writes about food. If I don’t complain about this, who the hell will? People in the hospitality industry do their jobs around meal times. For many years the meals offered both to waiters and kitchen staff was a major issue. Too many restaurants simply didn’t seem to care. Happily, that is generally no longer the case (although there are still exceptions). Musicians, the ones who work in bars and restaurants, hotels and events such as weddings, are too often the forgotten hospitality workers.

The majority of the Jamaican immigrants who came to the UK in the 50s settled there – my own grandparents plumped for Stevenage, just north of the city. And yet, in the 2011 census, it was estimated that up to 5,000 of Britain’s then 160,000 Jamaican-born population – and plenty more West Indians besides – live in Leeds, the northern city I moved to as an adult. In celebration of Jamaica’s 60th anniversary of independence, the Leeds community have chosen to mark their own contribution to the city’s culture with the Out of Many festival, a Lottery-funded string of arts and cultural events named after Jamaica’s motto.Five days before the launch of its opening exhibition, Rebellion to Romance, curator Susan Pitter shows me around the floorspace at Leeds central library.

Firstly, he succeeded in making a song his own – the holy grail of TV talent shows – via his gloriously OTT rendition of Britney Spears’ Baby One More Time on Popstars in 2001. Dressed somewhere between a roll-necked Steve Jobs and a swashbuckling musketeer, he became the instant star of a show that spectacularly failed in its remit to create stars.For his second trick, he re-emerged later that year looking like a matinee idol and singing like Elvis to finish third on Pop Idol and later land himself a UK No 1 single with Colourblind.

Not the best, not the most impressive or life-changing – the funniest. Chances are it took place in a high street club called Revenge or GLAM or something with the words “Bar &amp; Grill” on the end. A sweatbox with laminated booklets of sambuca deals strewn along the bar and posters for pyjama parties glued to the walls with Tresemmé Freeze Hold and body fluids. They are the temples of “90s, pop and cheese”. The places you go to celebrate your A-level results, or on a Tuesday. They are the cornerstones of British culture, and they are dying.Figures shared by the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) this month revealed that there are only 1,130 nightclubs left in England, Wales and Scotland. That’s a 20% drop since March 2020. The UK’s nighttime economy has long been in tatters, with small music venues shuttering at a rate of one a month even before the pandemic (98% of grassroots venues are rented, leaving them especially vulnerable). However, the more recent storm of financial pressures has led to renewed calls for government support. The NTIA attributes club closures to a “culmination of pandemic debt, growing energy bills, workforce challenges, supply chain issues, insurance premiums and landlord pressures” – big-picture problems that require big-picture solutions. In the meantime, the question for the average person is: where do we go to get on it now?

Calling themselves Lining Time, this assemblage of dance and theatre students arrived at their own understanding of music as creative expression.Training in theatre language at the Dartington College of Arts had given the group a medium to tell their stories; injustices such as Thatcherite policies, the Falklands war and endemic violence against women compelled them.

So what drives him on?Like most of us, the current turmoil in British politics has seen Johnny Flynn – actor, folk musician, the kind of multi-hyphenate who plays the hurdy-gurdy – spend the past few weeks doom-scrolling and current-affairs-obsessing. Flynn is a multitasker. He is obsessed with news anchors and reporters and follows many of them on Twitter, noting, with alarm, how they think social media is the most important thing in the world. He now wakes up each morning with such genuinely worrying thoughts as: I wonder what Jacob Rees-Mogg said about Liz Truss last night. He likens the fearful voices drowned out by the media circus to a character in a Greek tragedy. Cassandra, he reckons, was destined to tell the truth but be ignored (Flynn is not against a classical reference). He finds it all horrible and depressing and dispiriting. He loves it.For while it’s purgatory for the rest of us, for Flynn, it’s also research. He’s currently in Belfast, midway through shooting a new series called The Lovers, where he’s playing a self-obsessed political journalist – a “slightly younger Robert Peston or Andrew Marr”, he says, “one who is in with the millennials, or at least thinks he is”.

This is the Houston rapper’s first big headline performance since 2021’s Astroworld festival – an event founded by Scott – where a fatal crowd crush resulted in the accidental deaths of 10 people and hundreds of injuries. It’s clear the incident affected him. During a supporting slot for Meek Mill in New York earlier this year, Scott stopped mid-show when an audience member climbed up on the lighting rig. It was a striking moment, because even a year ago, he might not have called out this kind of behaviour.Sometimes known as La Flame, the rapper is very excited tonight: he shouts out his daughter, Stormy, and runs around the stage, limbs flailing in zigzags, every now and again flopping his body down with his arms grazing the ground, like a tired robot (an image enhanced by his aesthetic choices: he wears a futuristic-looking pair of white goggles with tiny slits).

Festival co-founder Peter Gabriel is here, of course, introducing Ghanaian-British rock band Osibisa, praising their role in popularising African music here back in the 70s, and harking back to the first Womad in 1982, when their singer and dancer Angie Anderson was also with the dance company Ekome, who backed Gabriel on his performance of Biko. The Congolese soukous veteran Kanda Bongo Man, still as rousing a performer as ever, said that his UK debut at Womad in 1983 “took me from nowhere to the international market”. And those passionate exponents of Sufi devotional singing, the Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali, paid tribute to their uncle Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, whose 1985 Womad debut also received praise from Gabriel in an earlier onstage discussion of the festival’s history.But the festival also continues to look to the future and trails still being blazed. Sona Jobarteh, the continent’s first female kora-playing star, demonstrates her exquisite playing of the West African harp alongside a band that includes her 15-year-old son Sidiki on balafon. From Europe come Taraf de Caliu, four of whom were once international stars with Romanian Gypsy band Taraf de Haïdouks. They returned to Clejani, Romania after the band split and – fronted by new singer Florin Murgoi, who said he was a farmer in the village until they signed him up – they’re clearly delighted to be back with their thrilling, virtuoso blend of rapid-fire duelling violins and cimbalom.

Two years on, there’s more controversy – the Texan rapper is currently engaged in a bitter legal battle with her record label – but her mood has clearly changed. The title of Good News’ follow-up is derived from “a chemical released in the brain when it is forced to deal with painful emotions caused by traumatic events”; the video announcing its release featured a funeral, gatecrashed by Megan Thee Stallion in an absolutely enormous hat. “I’m on my fuck-you shit, bitch, I’m done being nice,” she announces a few minutes after Traumazine begins.You can say that again: there are fleeting and very occasional references to wider current events, including Roe v Wade – “my body, my motherfucking choice,” she snaps on Gift and a Curse – but Traumazine largely sticks to the topic of what she calls “fake-ass, snake-ass, backstabbing, hatin’-ass, no money, kidding-ass bitches”. Suitably riled, she comes out swinging to such a degree that even the rhymes about sex feel strangely confrontational and pugilistic. Red Wine has her “looking at your pretty face while I’m straddling it”: her delivery makes it sound as if she’s describing murdering someone, rather than showing them a good time.

No Gold Teeth, for instance, has a funk bassline so gummy you could chew it contentedly like cud for hours, with Black Thought, one of the most erudite wordsmiths of his generation, riding the beat like a dancer. “Please, you ain’t fuckin’ with no amateurs, homie,” he sneers, correct on that count as he is on numerous others here: razor-sharp takedowns of racial injustice and masterful braggadocio. No filler, all killer, once on, you’ll have trouble peeling Cheat Codes off the turntable or, indeed, Spotify.But this banging summer album also comes with an unrequited mutual appreciation bromance subplot. In 2006, a white-hot young hip-hop producer in deep legal trouble with a major label met his rapper hero, only a few years his senior. When Danger Mouse – Brian Burton – was still in high school, he paid a friend to steal the Roots’ second album, Do You Want More ?!!!??! (1995), for less than the inflated CD price (though this wasn’t the source of his later legal headaches). When they finally met, the Roots’ Black Thought (Tariq Trotter) and his acolyte hit it off. The two thought they might make a record. Dangerous Thoughts was mooted as a title.

"90","Star Feminine Band: In Paris review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month","1660291207000","(Born Bad Records)The prodigious performers from Benin showcase their astounding pace of musical development, having only picked up their instruments for the first time in 2016Benin’s Star Feminine Band have had a remarkable journey to releasing their music. The seven-piece all-female group, aged between 12 and 19, only began learning their instruments in 2016, after participating in a free music workshop in their remote home town of Natitingou. Following two years of after-school rehearsals, the group came to the attention of French engineer Jérémie Verdier, who recorded demos of the band’s celebratory mix of Ghanaian highlife melody, earthy Congolese rumba and folk sato rhythms.Those tapes made their way to Parisian label Born Bad Records and in 2020 the band debuted with a self-titled album. Confronting their status as one of the only groups in Benin to feature women playing instruments, they produced songs such as Peba and Femme Africaine, which advocated for their place in society.

"91","Danger Mouse & Black Thought: Cheat Codes review – brimming with sheer love of the craft","1660289405000","(BMG)Contemplating everything from hip-hop to the human condition, the ebullient and long-awaited collaboration is awash with cinematic beats and vivid rhymesIf Cheat Codes – a joint album with Tariq Trotter AKA Black Thought on the mic and Brian Burton AKA Danger Mouse at the controls – feels long overdue, it’s because it is: the pair first conceived the record 15 years ago. Back then, Burton had made a name for himself as a maverick producer, moving from his bootlegged Beatles x Jay-Z mashup into his stint as half of pop-R&amp;B project Gnarls Barkley. Trotter, meanwhile, was recording and touring as frontman of the Roots. An incendiary 10-minute freestyle in late 2017 reinstated his status as one of rap’s title contenders, heralding his 2020 solo album. It’s in this moment of resurgence that Burton returns to hip-hop, the pair pouring themselves into an ebullient record brimming with sheer love of the craft.Both Burton and Trotter have an uncanny ability for scene-setting, the former wringing funk and jazz into a seamless sequence of cinematic beats somewhere between spaghetti western and crime drama, the latter readily supplying vivid rhymes. On Aquamarine, Trotter rides the ascent of a soaring instrumental to share metaphysical truths, historicise human evolution and reveal his own talent. “My bandwidth is a canvas cut from its frame / When I present ideas, naked and unashamed / It’s handwritten in Sanskrit on the 7 train,” he raps, signing off a verse that covers his name’s Quranic connotations and finds rhymes for Juilliard. Raekwon, A$AP Rocky and more guest on the album but all – save for MF Doom’s posthumous appearance – stand in Trotter’s shadow. Capably soundtracked by Burton, his soliloquies manifest as a window into himself, hip-hop and the human condition.

"92","Brahms: The Four Symphonies review | Andrew Clements' classical album of the week","1660226444000","Danish Chamber Orch/Adam Fischer(Naxos, three CDs)Emulating Brahms himself with an orchestra of fewer than 50 players, these fresh, engaging recordings show that less can mean a lot moreThough these days we generally hear the Brahms symphonies performed by a full-sized symphony orchestra of 70 or 80 players, the composer himself is said to have preferred smaller forces. The orchestra in Karlsruhe, which introduced his First Symphony, had 49 players, the Meiningen Court Orchestra, responsible for the premiere of the Fourth, numbered 48. Thomas Dausgaard recorded the four symphonies with a band of that size for BIS, and now Adam Fischer has followed his example; the exact number of players he uses isn’t given in the sleeve notes, but a photograph of the Danish Chamber Orchestra suggests there are fewer than 50 of them, and certainly these constantly fascinating performances demonstrate that, even in Brahms, less can mean a lot more.These aren’t period-instrument performances, though it does sound as if Fischer has encouraged his strings to ration their use of vibrato; it’s their scale, and the greater transparency that comes with using fewer strings, that pays such dividends, allowing the woodwind and brass to make their presence felt without any over-emphasis. Fischer adds even more buoyancy by paying scrupulous attention to every detail of the rhythmic articulation; he generally favours quick tempo too, though it’s rare that they seem unduly fast – the finale of the Second sets off at quite a lick, for instance, yet never seems rushed, while the finale of the Fourth loses none of its cumulative power by always being kept on the move.

"93","Hudson Mohawke: Cry Sugar review – happy hardcore will never die","1660215640000","(Warp)Joining the dots between rave and contemporary hip-hop, the Scottish producer’s feverish third solo album hovers on the edge of chaosIf you believe the accompanying press release, Glasgow-born, LA-based Ross Birchard has spent the six years since his last album as Hudson Mohawke engaged in variety of intriguing activities. The sometime Kanye West and Drake producer has variously set up barbecues outside clubs, ready to feed bleary-eyed ravers at 7am; running “Bob Ross-style” art classes for his fellow electronic auteurs and conducting a 12-step programme designed to rid people of irony. The reality seems to be that he’s spent recent years thinking about his past. In 2020, he put out three mixtapes of previously unreleased archive material, some of it dating back to the mid-00s. His new album, meanwhile, harks back even further, to the kind of bouncy happy hardcore popular in Scotland when he was a kid, which presumably trickled into his life via radio and rave tape packs.In truth, it’s an influence that Birchard has never really got away from. He’s periodically resurrected his teenage DJ persona Mayhem and sampled happy hardcore producer Darren Styles on Shadows, from his 2015 album Lantern. That track also featured a writing credit for another hardcore legend, Gammer, with whom Birchard has regularly collaborated. Under the circumstances, it’s hard not to hope that he spent at least some of his time in the court of Kanye West trying to interest Ye in the oeuvres of Hixxy and Dougal.

"94","Hot Chip: Freakout/ Release review – trying hard to be funky","1660464005000","(Domino)The British dance-pop favourites make forays into the wilder side, but their mellow tempo prevailsIndefatigably pleasant, Hot Chip have long specialised in steady-state club pop, powered more by melancholy than abandon. The title track of their eighth album, the promisingly named Freakout/Release, declares a shift towards proper shit-losing catharsis. “Wild, beast, freakout, release!” growls a vocoder as some stark electro-funk lurks beneath. A distorted guitar line completes the picture of a band throwing well-appointed tastefulness to the wind, querying their own love of music into the bargain. Co-producers Soulwax are audibly in the studio, egging them on.Spoiler alert: it’s false advertising. Sure, some strides are made towards messiness. On Down, the disco-funk album opener, singer Joe Goddard swaps his usual evolved restraint for something like tongue-in-cheek libidinality. But Hard to Be Funky, a lovely, downtempo glide that features the guest vocals of Lou Hayter, once of New Young Pony Club, nails Hot Chip’s dilemma with self-deprecating humour. “It’s hard to be funky when you’re not feeling sexy,” Goddard notes. “And it’s hard to feel sexy when you’re not very funky.” Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/14/hot-chip-freakout-release-review-trying-hard-to-be-funky"
"95","Niki: Nicole review – introspective indie from an artist in search of her sound","1660485611000","(88rising)Familiar love stories and shades of Phoebe Bridgers characterise the young American’s delicate second albumAlthough only 23, the Indonesian American singer-songwriter Nicole Zefanya, AKA Niki, has already experimented with multiple iterations of her sound. Her 2018 debut EP, Zephyr, traded on the bass-forward, hook-laden R&amp;B exemplified by the likes of SZA and Jhené Aiko, while her 2020 album, Moonchild, moved into atmospheric synth-pop. Her second album, Nicole, foregrounds softly strumming guitars for 12 tracks of introspective indie.Where Zefanya’s vocal used to showcase a sturdier soul sound, Nicole finds her stripped back to a more delicate, almost spoken falsetto. It’s a choice that works well for packing in the lines of her storytelling material, from recounting a long-distance romance (Before), to a high-school flirtation (High School in Jakarta) and a lost love (Oceans &amp; Engines). A familiar arc is traced – love found, fought for and taken away – while Zefanya delivers each song in an equally familiar confessional style, building from light melodies to crescendos of roiling emotion.

While that transformation may apply to her most famous role as Sandy in the musical Grease, it does a disservice to how ably – and convincingly – the chameleonic British-Australian musician shape-shifted between genres and rode the changing moods of pop to become one of the biggest hit-makers of her era and an enduring cult icon.Newton-John broke out at the beginning of the 1970s as a country-pop singer, with single If Not For You, a Bob Dylan cover, becoming an unexpected hit in North America. She cemented her reputation in the genre with the assertive, Grammy-winning Let Me Be There, her first US Top 10 hit, the ballad I Honestly Love You and the plaintive Please Mr Please, which reached No 3 in the US pop charts, No 5 in its country charts and No 1 in easy listening. By 1974, she had been named female vocalist of the year by the Country Music Association, and not without controversy – Newton-John beat Nashville royalty such as Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to the prize, which prompted an industry protest.

Surely this is premature?There are many things you notice as you plow deeper into your 30s. It’s a transitional period with incredibly visible milestones: babies, weddings, houses, more babies. What gets added to people’s lives can feel loud and inescapable – but often what drifts away is less visible.For the last few years, I have felt the inescapable disappearance of music from my friends’ lives. Even people with whom I have longstanding relationships that were born from a shared love of music have simply let it go, or let it fade deep into the background. A 2015 study of people’s listening habits on Spotify found that most people stop listening to new music at 33; a 2018 report by Deezer had it at 30. In my 20s, the idea that people’s appetite to consume new music regularly would be switched off like some kind of tap was ludicrous. However, now I’m 36, it’s difficult to argue with.

So why has he played for two professional teams?The Scarborough Shooting Stars came within a single basket of winning the Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL) title on Sunday, losing to the Hamilton Honey Badgers by just two points after a run of 17 unanswered in the fourth quarter. Despite their heartbreaking loss, Scarborough’s season should still be considered a success – the team made it to the championship game in their first year in the league, and the high-scoring duo of Jalen Harris and Kassius Robertson are a dynamic backcourt around which to build. Harris even once scored 31 points against the Luka Doncic-led Dallas Mavericks. Yet, despite his NBA pedigree, Harris is not even the most well-known guard on his team. That distinction falls to Grammy-winning rap artist J Cole. Or, more accurately in this context, 6ft 3in Shooting Stars guard Jermaine Cole.Hip-hop and basketball have maintained their ongoing relationship ever since the former first emerged in 1970s New York. Kurtis Blow, widely regarded as rap’s first commercially successful artist, famously announced in the 1980s that basketball was his favorite sport, 90s rap mogul Master P played on the preseason squads for both the Charlotte Hornets and Toronto Raptors, and platinum-selling artist 2 Chainz released a 2010s album called Rap or Go to the League. Comedian Dave Chappelle even once humorously observed that it seemed like rapping or playing basketball were the only two ways to make it out of America’s inner cities. And yet, even with hip hop’s well-established relationship with basketball, there’s probably never been anyone who better personifies the connection than J Cole.
