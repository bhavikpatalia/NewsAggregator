Here’s what a professional reviewer made of itAs has become the wont of major artists, the debut from the Black Hole dropped so suddenly on Sunday that it might as well have landed from outer space. Which, er, in fact it did. Nasa’s recording of rumbling sound waves from the Perseus galaxy cluster, 200m light years away, sounds, on first hearing, like a lot of submerged wailing – or indeed whales – but like many a classic, takes time to reveal its true complexity and profundity. The 34-second recording is a mantra-like loop or cycle, suggesting the influence of the 1970s German Krautrock bands Neu! and Can, and their gospel of repetition in music.The sounds – striking, eerie, disturbing but strangely soothing and balm-like – have been compared to Björk but will also be recognisable to anyone familiar with Brian Eno’s 1983 ambient colossus Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, which has obviously struck a chord in the outer limits. Strikingly, Nasa’s recording sounds absolutely nothing like Muse’s 2006 epic Supermassive Black Hole, a song that has long been the authority on these things, but now suddenly sounds like the work of a funky three-piece rock band from Teignmouth, rather than prophets of the space-time continuum. One Twitter user has compared the real Black Hole to Pink Floyd’s spacious 1971 masterpiece Echoes, but conceptually, it’s perhaps more in the spirit of their 1968 psychedelic era opus A Saucerful of Secrets. After all, what is a black hole if not a cavernous deep space, which contains all sorts of mysteries and inner meanings?

He explains the roots of his lifelong passionWhen Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman honoured the 50th anniversary of the Byrds’ 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo by touring it for the first time, there was only one man who could lead their backing band: Marty Stuart. When Ken Burns began filming 2019’s Country Music documentary series, it was Stuart who guided the director through the genre. From Porter Wagoner to Johnny Cash, many Nashville icons have called on Stuart to play with them. Stuart is country’s ruling polymath – a musician whose skill on guitar and mandolin is matched by his encyclopaedic knowledge and vast enthusiasm.If you only go to one country music concert, then let it be Marty Stuart’s – he’s about to tour the UK for the first time in five years, so the opportunity awaits. “I like playing the UK,” says Stuart. “First of all, I think there is an appreciation for authentic country music over there that sometimes gets lost in America.

But will its algorithm be able to handle our novice writer’s rubbish rhymes?I may be many things, but I’m not a rapper. I discover this when I’m asked to freestyle a few verses on a visit to London’s Abbey Road recording studios. Immediately lines from famous rappers flood into my head – some classic Biggie, a few Young Thug yelps, the theme to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air – but I’ve got to think up something original.Out of desperation, I decide to rap about my morning routine. Adopting a slow pace and simple rhyme scheme that even the Sugarhill Gang would disdain, I begin: “I wake up at seven and I brush my teeth.” Already I am at a loss. What rhymes with “teeth”? Panicking, I look at the computer in front of me, which is running a demo of iRap, AI software built to assist lyric writing in real time.

The exceptions, however, are on show at ArcTanGent, which has returned to Fernhill farm after a Covid-warranted hiatus to showcase the best of loud yet convention-shattering music. A reputation for quality bookings has seen the three-day event grow to five stages and a capacity of 10,000 in less than a decade, and the 2022 edition accompanies that growing scope with the best lineup yet.Fes make for a vibrant start on Thursday. The math-rockers prove intellectual tunes needn’t skimp on a good pop hook, as frontperson Pollyanna Holland-Wing sings while playing guitar like a virtuoso. A sombre counterweight comes from instrumentalists Pijn, who accentuate their devastation with sorrowful violins. They’re the first of a legion of post-metal bands to decimate this weekend. The genre shines brightest – ironically – with the hellish density of Thursday headliners Cult of Luna. The sextet could be the world’s heaviest band, and hearing behemoth songs such as Blood Upon Stone blast out of fog thicker than John Carpenter could conjure up affirms that idea. It’s the apex of the festival, their closest rivals being Amenra. The Belgians are an existential crisis in sonic form, casting dread-laden post-metal against panicked shrieks to curate the most perfect kind of horrible.

As a teenager she performed in metal bands, moshed at gigs, went to UK bass music and dubstep nights and danced to hefty sound systems.

Squeezing her “Christmas bubble” of friends into her living room, Iceland’s most famous citizen was throwing another of her “crazy DJ nights, where 20 people could come and I always ended up DJing just gabber”.According to Björk, the nails-hard 90s Dutch techno style is the perfect soundtrack to Covid life. “There’s always a BPM in our bodies, you know? And I think through Covid we were all pretty lazy, just sitting home reading books, so when we got drunk or partied it was like we went a little bit mental, then we just fell asleep before midnight.

Now he’s ready to see if people want to hear the guy behind the gagsWhen he was “around 14”, Bret McKenzie became obsessed with the Leonard Cohen album I’m Your Man. Its synth-heavy tales of geopolitics, romantic devotion and the poems of Federico García Lorca made it an unusual choice for a pubescent boy in suburban New Zealand. Nevertheless, at school, he and his friends would happily sing along to tracks such as Jazz Police and First We Take Manhattan when passing between lessons.As they sang, McKenzie listened to the voices of his peers, plumbing Cohen’s baritone depths. Meanwhile his own, still unbroken, squeaked along beside them. Even then, he saw the comedy in this collision: the autumnal wit of the lyrics, the juvenile scratch of the voice. It instilled in him a new sense of how songs could be: “Serious, but also strange, and funny in a weird way,” is how he describes it. “I think that’s always stuck with me.” Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/20/bret-mckenzie-flight-of-the-conchords-interview-songs-without-jokes","70","ENTERTAINMENT"

It meant that our throats got larger, which enabled us to extend the sounds we could make beyond animalistic hooting and howling. Suddenly, we could talk. We could develop a vocabulary. We could sing.This development marked the birth of music, yet we really know only about relatively recent developments in that enormous history. The world’s oldest known musical instrument – a Neanderthal flute carved from the bone of a bear, found in 1995 in a Slovenian cave – is just 50,000 years old. The oldest piece of written music is far younger: a spry 4,000 years old.

Umpteen stakeholders would have pondered the tour’s environmental aspects in the wake of Coldplay’s 2019 announcement that they would stop touring while they worked out how to make it less worse for the planet.Sceptics should note that the band’s light-up wristbands, always magical, are now made of compostable plastic.

"86","Aitch: Close to Home review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week","1660820444000","(Capitol)Referencing the Stone Roses and featuring Shaun Ryder, the Manchester rapper’s debut album stops short of a second coming – but it pushes his musical boundaries and subverts traditional hip-hop narrativesAt the time of writing, the face of Harrison Armstrong – better known as Aitch – stares down from bus shelters around Britain advertising Lynx deodorant. You can snigger at this development if you like – it’s hardly Jay-Z endorsing luxury Swiss watches – but it’s worth noting that not every multi-platinum US rapper deals exclusively in high-end products: as well as promoting Balenciaga, Megan Thee Stallion recently recorded a track shilling Cheetos, the American equivalent of becoming the glamorous face of Wotsits. Moreover, it tells you something about the spread of UK rap and the position Armstrong currently occupies in British youth culture: there was a time, before Skepta and Stormzy, when a rapper with a Mancunian accent would have got no further than a tiny local label. Today, if you want to reach a big market of odiferous adolescent boys, Aitch, with a string of Top 10 hits to his name – five of them platinum sellers – is very much your guy.A man who last year did a photoshoot in the former headquarters of Factory Records, Aitch has described his debut album Close to Home as “100,000% a proper Manchester album”. A rumoured collaboration with Liam Gallagher is nowhere to be seen, but Shaun Ryder’s voice booms out between tracks (as does that of Aitch’s dad, calling him “a knobhead” for failing to provide receipts for his expenses). His song 1989 samples the Stone Roses’ Fools Gold and pays homage to Madchester’s annus mirabilis in its title, if not its lyrics. The special edition vinyl cover is by Matt Carroll of Central Station Design, the company best known for designing the Happy Mondays’ album sleeves, who has been quick to place Aitch in a lineage of “great wordsmiths from Manchester’s past” – including not just Ryder, but John Cooper Clarke. Those comparisons are pushing it a bit. (And perhaps not helped by his team accidentally destroying a beloved local Ian Curtis mural.) You could just about make a case for a similarity between Aitch’s nasal delivery and that of Cooper Clarke, though there’s none of Ryder’s drugged-out surrealism about his lyrical approach. But Aitch’s lyrics are definitely at their most striking when they abandon the standard-issue stuff about trapping in the bandos to root themselves in his home town, whether hymning family ties on R Kid or mistily recalling a youth spent “smoking in the alley and buying singles from a shabby gaff”. “Back then I had to Rusholme if you grew up in Moston,” he recalls in a neat bit of wordplay on Money Habits.

On his 21st official album he’s in the concept game again. Previous records have been inspired by role-playing games and an adolescence of listening to goth bands; now Bleed Out takes its lead from the bloody revenges exacted by the protagonists of action movies, set to indie rock that veers from folky to near metal in Wage Wars Get Rich Die Handsome.It’s not a novelty record – Darnielle has said he is fascinated by the fact that revenge seems so appealing precisely because it’s unavailable to those who don’t live in action movies – but it’s shot through with pop-culture references, and images that are familiar to anyone who watches movies in which gun-toting men pursue their nemeses. Training Montage’s title is utterly on the nose: it describes the set-up everyone has seen a thousand times. Cliches are nailed throughout the album, down to men who “have loosely gathered / To stand in doorways / Making small talk / About the weather”, in Guys on Every Corner.

In the past she has made an LP of drones for yoga and meditation, a new age album that was premiered on the Calm app, and she’s even written a pocketbook called Listening (complete with cards featuring “listening exercises”).But Smith is also a leading figure in modular synthesis. She studied composition and sound engineering at Berklee College of Music, falling under the spell of Steve Reich, and later acquired an enormous Buchla synthesiser, using it to make several solo albums of burbling electronica. She has also made a synth-pop concept album about the life cycle, recorded a duet with her mentor Suzanne Ciani and another collaboration with Hollywood composer Emile Mosseri.

"89","The Chats: Get Fucked review – Brisbane’s reprobate punks trade novelty for longevity","1660939221000","They may never recapture the naive charm of their viral debut – but the playing is tighter, the music tougher, and the songs still crackle with energyGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailLet’s start with the title. The Chats don’t care what you think, and even less (I hope) what the Guardian thinks. This band did not care what Karl Stefanovic thought when they ran around the set of the Today show. And nor should they, as a reprobate punk band from Pig City, AKA Brisbane (via the Sunshine Coast).That said, there are some signs of growing pains on Get Fucked, the follow-up to 2020’s High Risk Behaviour. In some ways, this album is to the Chats what Leave Home was to Ramones: it’s tighter, with better playing and a tougher sound, but lacks some of the naive charm that made their debut so endearing. They have also lost guitarist Josh Price, and he takes a little of the Chats’ humour with him.

"90","Watkins Family Hour: Vol II review – a great night out with ringside seats","1661007643000","(Family Hour)US siblings Sara and Sean Watkins are joined by Fiona Apple, Jackson Browne and more on another set of old classics and new favourites in Nashville formIt takes a special chemistry for any residency to endure for 20 years. As much shines through this celebration of the monthly get-together hosted by the sibling duo Sara and Sean Watkins at LA’s Largo nightspot. As co-founders of the hugely successful (and innovative) bluegrass band Nickel Creek, since 2002 the Watkinses have attracted a stellar roster of friends and fellow travellers to revive yesteryear classics and garb new favourites in Nashville clothing.So it goes with this second studio gathering (the first was in 2015), which opens with The Way I Feel Inside, a 1965 song by Brit moptops the Zombies, recast with the help of New York indie outfit Lucius. More radical is the way (Remember Me) I’m the One Who Loves You, a chunk of loungecore schlock by Dean Martin, becomes a honky-tonk hoedown voiced by Fiona Apple. The late country pioneer Ernest Tubb is hauled into an R&amp;B version of Thanks a Lot by “Largo mascot” Jon Brion, while Willie Watson and Jackson Browne are among other notable contributors. Underpinning everything are the Watkinses themselves, especially the agile vocals of Sara, who outshines California art rockers Tune-Yards on a cover of their Hypnotized. But it’s not a competition, just a great night out with a ringside seat.

"91","Aitch: Close to Home review – staking his claim to the mainstream","1661083208000","(EMI)The sugar rushes are tempered by vulnerable, darker notes on the Manchester rapper’s hotly anticipated debutThe 22-year-old Manchester rapper Harrison Armstrong, AKA Aitch, has had a meteoric rise. His breakout, tongue-twisting 2018 track Straight Rhymez brought him to the attention of Stormzy, and singles Taste (Make It Shake) and Rain both reached the UK Top 10. Fresh-faced, with a cheeky grin, Armstrong gave voice to teen innuendoes while toting the gold chains of success.His debut album has been much anticipated. Boasting features from Ed Sheeran and AJ Tracey, these 16 tracks are Armstrong staking his claim to the mainstream. The results are largely predictable: singles 1989 and Baby interpolate samples from Ashanti’s 2003 hit Rock Wit U and Stone Roses anthem Fools Gold, with Armstrong’s verses as embellishment. Original production In Disguise plays like a pastiche of the Streets.

"92","Cass McCombs: Heartmind review – knotty nuance bathed in melodic succour","1661068803000","(Anti-)The turbulent, everyday lives of others populate the California singer-songwriter’s masterly new albumWhose emotions are these, anyway? Cass McCombs’s 10th album is an easy, rolling record that grapples with inner complexity, telling stories about musicians and soldiers, lovers and seekers. Even as this seasoned US singer-songwriter butts up against philosophical quandaries or quotes from Sufism, he never loses track of the everyday. When he isn’t making singular records, McCombs has worked in demolition and crashed on couches; his is a landscape of fast-food restaurants and karaoke machines, where vans break down, people make mistakes and die too soon.A gentle, psychedelic wash glazes this set of songs whose musical erudition is worn lightly. The album’s opener, Music Is Blue, is a masterclass in how to wring effortless prettiness out of progressive time signatures and jazz drums. The lovely Karaoke is a lovelorn Teenage Fanclub shuffle that wonders whether we all just perform secondhand emotions, where McCombs questions a relationship quoting everything from Unchained Melody to Stand By Your Man. The exceptional Unproud Warrior, by contrast, spins the tale of a soldier returned from war, living with the consequences of choices he has made; the question of his culpability is greyed out magnificently.

"93","Demi Lovato: Holy Fvck review – finally having fun","1661090410000","(Island)The US singer-songwriter shifts tack from last year’s trauma-led Dancing With the Devil, tapping into the pop-punk of her youthful debut“Am I the only one looking for substance?” sings Demi Lovato on her new single – to which the answer is, obviously, no. But her search for “substance” takes on a sharply different tone given that Lovato recovered from a near-fatal overdose in 2018, preceded by addiction, an eating disorder and being raped as a teenager. The experiences were chronicled in 2021’s Dancing With the Devil album and documentary – although the music stuck to an oddly tasteful pop palette. Holy Fvck signals a genuine shift. In the past year, Lovato has come out as non-binary, launched a sex toy and gone UFO-hunting in the desert; in short, it sounds like she’s finally having fun. The album harks back to the pop-punk sounds of her 2008 debut, Don’t Forget, with Skin of My Teeth pitched somewhere between McFly and Foo Fighters. But there are some thrillingly dark moments too, as on Eat Me (ft Royal &amp; the Serpent), with its industrial grind, tempo shifts and raging yelps, and the pleasingly lusty Bones. Holy Fvck has its flaws – Lovato’s powerful voice is unnecessarily finessed and Auto-Tuned, and 16 tracks is too long. But its gutsy ambition is a thing of substance in and of itself.

"94","Darius Campbell Danesh: an alluring mix of naivety, panache and genuine talent","1660723270000","His journey from tryer to survivor to established success story is unlike anything else seen in TV talent show historyIn the embryonic days of UK TV talent shows, Darius Campbell Danesh – whose death at the age of 41 was announced on Tuesday – did two genuinely revolutionary things. Firstly, he succeeded in making a song his own – the holy grail of TV talent shows – via his gloriously OTT rendition of Britney Spears’ Baby One More Time on Popstars in 2001. Dressed somewhere between a roll-necked Steve Jobs and a swashbuckling musketeer, he became the instant star of a show that spectacularly failed in its remit to create stars.For his second trick, he re-emerged later that year looking like a matinee idol and singing like Elvis to finish third on Pop Idol and later land himself a UK No 1 single with Colourblind. Reality TV is all about narratives and often they can build up around people and solidify like cement; somehow, via an alluring mix of naivety, panache and genuine talent, Darius was able to rewrite his.

While that transformation may apply to her most famous role as Sandy in the musical Grease, it does a disservice to how ably – and convincingly – the chameleonic British-Australian musician shape-shifted between genres and rode the changing moods of pop to become one of the biggest hit-makers of her era and an enduring cult icon.Newton-John broke out at the beginning of the 1970s as a country-pop singer, with single If Not For You, a Bob Dylan cover, becoming an unexpected hit in North America. She cemented her reputation in the genre with the assertive, Grammy-winning Let Me Be There, her first US Top 10 hit, the ballad I Honestly Love You and the plaintive Please Mr Please, which reached No 3 in the US pop charts, No 5 in its country charts and No 1 in easy listening. By 1974, she had been named female vocalist of the year by the Country Music Association, and not without controversy – Newton-John beat Nashville royalty such as Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to the prize, which prompted an industry protest.

"101","Pioneering female DJs deserve recognition for their contribution to club culture | Letter","1661262008000","Laila Mckenzie on the continuing fight to honour the major part that women have played the dance music industryYour article discussing the place of female DJs in dance music history books (‘There are still battles to be had, but it’s incredible’: the female DJs finally getting their dues, 21 July) included a quote: “In terms of the pioneers, it’s all men, and we can’t escape that.” With fellow author Ian “Snowy” Snowball, I wrote Lady of the House, a book published last November which strongly rebuts that claim. Crowdfunded by our dance music community and industry, this self-published book features 150 real-life stories of pivotal women from all walks of the scene, including many DJs, who are true pioneers. It was because of their input that we have the culture we have today. Women weren’t being documented truthfully for their contributions. Lady of the House is advocating to ensure women who work in dance music get the recognition they deserve, stepping up into a broader initiative, which is well respected for celebrating, championing and honouring women in dance music, and which has included the creation of an exhibition, participation in global conferences, club shows and festivals, and the recent launch of a record label. As a brown woman from a low socio-economic background who has worked in dance music for 20 years, I often wonder what people like me have to do to be acknowledged. Regardless of receiving that recognition or not, we will continue at the front and centre in the push for fair representation.Laila MckenzieCo-author, Lady of the House Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/23/pioneering-female-djs-deserve-recognition-for-their-contribution-to-club-culture","93","ENTERTAINMENT"

Nestled in the natural amphitheatre of a Welsh mountain valley, for two decades the festival has offered a suspension of reality that its annually returning devotees can only describe as “magic”. Where else can you find refuge from a festival’s never-ending spectacles to hold a chicken?In these intervening years, Green Man has fostered a certain intimacy with its audience, meaning the 25,000 tickets for its 20th-anniversary weekender sold out within three days despite the only confirmed headliner being Mercury-prize winner Michael Kiwanuka. But Green Man dares to roll the dice while remaining deserving of this blind faith. Though it remains loosely anchored to its folk-indebted beginnings, it also welcomes the absurd, the wonderful and the otherworldly.
