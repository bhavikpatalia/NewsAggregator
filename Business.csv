"147","The Guardian view on raising the minimum wage: winning the fight for £15 an hour | Editorial","1661290216000","Britain may be as close now to a general strike as it has ever been. To resolve industrial tensions means thinking bigWhen Labour members last year backed a £15 an hour minimum wage at their annual conference, Sir Keir Starmer ignored the vote. This year the Labour leader won’t be able to easily shrug off the policy. Real pay is falling faster than ever. Inflation could reach 18% next year – the highest since 1976. Against this backdrop, the Trades Union Congress is calling for a £15 minimum wage, up from £9.50. This appears a big step, but it ought not to surprise anyone. Britain is seeing a series of strikes being announced as workers seek pay rises in the face of the cost of living crisis. Alan Jones, the industrial correspondent of PA Media, thinks Britain is as close now to a general strike as it has ever been.With high inflation eating into most people’s incomes and only the top 1% seeing salaries keep up with prices, conflict over wages is all but inevitable. The TUC plan rests on raising the minimum wage from two-thirds of median hourly pay to three-quarters. It calls for a demand-led approach to the economy. Crucially, the TUC says Britain needs a collective bargaining structure that not only sets a minimum but some average rates of sector pay. In Europe, such schemes have seen more income equality and higher pay growth. If wages grew as fast as they did under the last Labour government, the TUC says, the minimum wage would hit £15 an hour in 2030. Sir Keir ought to be as ambitious as the last Labour administration.

"148","China’s property market is in freefall. What does this mean for the world economy? | Keyu Jin","1661248803000","The sector is dangerously overheated – but unlike the 2008 financial crisis, the global ripple effect is likely to be limitedThe property sector in the Chinese economy has always been something of a puzzle. At its peak, it accounted for a quarter of the nation’s economic output, broadly measured. And it sees people in Beijing and Shanghai paying house prices similar to those in San Francisco and New York, despite having just a quarter the income of American buyers.Now many believe that we are about to see a violent contraction of the property market in China. The government wants to intervene to curb speculation, and rein in what it calls the “three high” problem: high prices, high debt and high financialisation. The approach has been nothing short of dramatic. Financing for property developers has tanked. Earlier this year, property sales declined by as much as 20-30%, in-progress developments are not being completed and people have taken to the streets, banding together to stop mortgage payments on such projects in protest.Keyu Jin is a professor of economics at LSE Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/23/china-property-market-world-economy"

One of the businesses making strides in that respect is PwC, which has a consulting executive team made up of equal numbers of men and women.Here, five women from PwC’s consulting practice reflect on promotion, their work-life balance, and what they wish they’d known at the start of their careers.
