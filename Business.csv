From strikes to civil disobedience, people are taking matters into their own handsI remember during the darkest period of the pandemic that there was a feeling the British government had truly abandoned people to their fate. The daily briefings had become an insulting game of denial and lies, the death count was rising, PPE and track-and-trace debacles were unfolding, lockdown policy was clearly unstudied and the prime minister had refused even to meet the families of Covid victims. Around the time when those bereaved families began to organise and campaign for an inquiry, it became clear that the comfort, resources and momentum for reform that people needed was not going to be forthcoming from the government. Citizens were going to have to do it themselves.That sense of a body politic and government entirely unsuited to crisis has come around again, and with it the same realisation that change is not going to come from our politicians, not unless they are dragged into it. England currently feels like an eerie, unpoliced, ungoverned, unstable country after a coup. One government is gone but another hasn’t replaced it, and opposition cannot rise to the challenge. Bureaucracy continues to function on inertia, with queues and backlogs and bottlenecks. Private capital, already rapacious and unregulated, grinds on ever more aggressively, extracting profits for basic services such as water and gas, as if we were living in a war economy.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/22/england-citizens-ungoverned-unstable-strikes-civil-disobedience"

Almost one in eight workers in the UK “won” the right to perform digital tasks remotely in 2021 by bidding for “jobs” on the web. The TUC says that the proportion of the working population being paid for such digital tasks at least once a week has more than doubled since 2016. Yet almost two in three microworkers – many of whom have a degree – earn less than £4 an hour. This is not only below the minimum wage, but also less than a quarter of the median graduate starting salary.The demand for microwork has increased with the rise of artificial intelligence, which needs human input to nudge computers in the right direction. Big tech companies employ, often anonymously through platforms, workforces that control quality and train AI. This type of employment boomed during the pandemic. People who lost their jobs or their income during lockdown ended up getting work that only needed an internet connection. Now, UK-based workers seeking to supplement their income at a time of double-digit inflation see microwork as a necessary side hustle.

Since that seminal moment when the world locked down in the face of the Covid pandemic, this digital acceleration has only continued, as companies sought to accommodate fundamental changes to their customers’ behaviour.It has now become amply clear that those customers were changing not only the way that they shopped and used services, but also the way they looked at the world. According to a 2021 report by the consultancy Accenture, the pandemic compelled consumers – en masse – to shift their expectations more rapidly and completely than at any other time in history. The report included the results of a survey of more than 25,000 consumers across 22 countries, half of whom said they felt the pandemic had caused them to re-evaluate what is important to them in life, and that they would abandon brands that didn’t support their new values.
