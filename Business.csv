It just turned out that way. Perhaps it was after the 1970s oil crisis that politicians began to suspect such appeals were too great an electoral risk. Perhaps it got another push from the financial crisis of 2008. Either way, the mindset still remains strong of not trusting or relying on the public to stay the course when normality is put on hold.No modern British politician would now make the speech that Franklin Roosevelt did when he became US president in 1933. “If I read the temper of our people correctly,” Roosevelt said in his first inaugural, “we now realise as we have never realised before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective.” Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/truss-sunak-sunshine-sacrifices-dark-times"

Here are some top tips on staying the course from people in the knowDo your researchYou can wobble on the precipice of starting a business for some time, says Katy Davies, founder of Ecojiko, a plastic-free online store. It’s important to use that time to research your market, product range and target audience. “There’s a lot of work that goes on before you launch. It’s mainly about trying to find the right product. I got lots of different samples from all over the world,” she says. CBI Insights has found 35% of startups fail because they haven’t found a market need, focusing on a problem that’s interesting to solve instead. Once you think you have the right product, start small, adds Davies. “Just buy 100 of one item to test it. We started with our zero-waste kitchen starter kit and it grew from there.”Put yourself out thereCaroline Bee says she was “shaking like a leaf” the first time she approached a stockist about her beeswax food wrap brand, Bee Retro. “But you’ve got to be proactive and have faith that people will love what you do. And the ones that don’t, don’t matter.” Founders should also be open to evolving their target audience, she adds. Originally she was approaching craft shops but has found high-end food shops make much more sense. And there have been surprises, too. “We’re in the Eden Project, Paignton zoo, Newquay airport. It’s not always [who] you think it’s going to be when you start out.” Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/how-retail-got-real/2022/aug/02/have-faith-people-will-love-what-you-do-startup-founders-reveal-seven-tips-for-success"
"116","Creative spaces: seven ways the new retail world is making life more real","1659451189000","The rise of local independent shops, selling products that are often artisanal and responsibly sourced, creates a greater sense of communityEver since humans moved on from barter systems, shopping has been an integral part of life – which means that the transformation of shopping habits in recent years has had far-reaching effects. Digital shopping seemed to be turning the element of human interaction into faceless transactions, making shopping more perfunctory. But a renaissance of independent shops and brands – and consumer support for them – has also sparked a resurgence of other intangible things, such as serendipity and community. Here are some of the ways these shifts have affected our everyday lives:Creating a sense of place The resurgence of independent retailers is breathing new life into communities, creating spaces and a sense of place where customers can experience brands from a variety of makers and designers, from food and fashion to art and lifestyle. Shopping online may have the advantage in terms of speed and convenience, but buying from a small, local store, where you can see, smell, touch, and even taste some of the products on offer creates a physical shopping experience that no amount of e-commerce technology can compete with.

"118","Rewilding retail: the independents putting the ‘human’ factor back into shopping","1659451397000","Local independent retailers are bringing enjoyment back to the high street by sourcing diverse and quirky productsThe act of shopping has undergone radical transformations in recent years. Indeed, it can be hard to get a handle on what we even mean by shopping any more. Is it primarily an activity conducted hunched in front of a laptop screen? Or on a mobile phone? Is it dominated by chain shops in giant shopping malls as local high streets wither and die? Or, on the contrary, is it characterised by a recent renaissance of local independent retailers and original brands – a kind of rewilding of the natural retail ecosystem.While the pandemic caused a huge surge in online shopping, it also prompted a resurgence of local shopping as customers sought a retail experience that was more sustainable, more experiential, more local and simply more human. A survey by marketing agency Gekko revealed the yearning that people had for the “human” factor that had been absent during lockdowns. What 62% of respondents missed most about physical shopping was the ability to see, hold and try a product, while 52% missed the ability to browse, and 52% were pining for the sheer enjoyment of shopping.

Suddenly coins and notes are back in favourA year ago, buying a Starbucks coffee didn’t feel “real” to Samantha Thomas. “It was just tapping,” the 41-year-old private tutor from Wigan says. “It didn’t feel like real money, it was just my card.” Nowadays, Thomas pulls out a £5 note every time she wants a hot drink. “When you’re physically handing over solid money,” she says, “it just makes you think twice.”For the last 12 months, Thomas has been a cash-only consumer. She leaves her debit card at home when she does her weekly food shop, bringing only the budget she has allocated in notes. As a result, Thomas could “sit here and tell you to the penny” what most items in the supermarket cost. “I know that if I go to Aldi something would cost me 6p less than if I went to Asda and about 5p less than if I went to Tesco,” she says.

"126","Insurer Phoenix Life is indifferent to my elderly aunt’s plight","1660716007000","She paid £100,000 in to a plan in case she needed long-term care. Now she does, I can’t make contact with itI hold power of attorney for my elderly widowed aunt, whose ill health required her to be admitted to long-term nursing care. In 2001, she and her husband paid £100,000 into a long-term care bond with Phoenix Life for exactly this eventuality. Last November, I tried to initiate a claim to fund her care, but have so far not succeeded. In frustration I contacted a solicitor who wrote to Phoenix on my behalf and eventually managed, with difficulty, to initiate a complaint in March. It has not been addressed, the claim has not been processed, and my aunt’s financial situation has become critical. Documents have been requested several times despite being sent by registered mail, there is no direct email to contact the company, and the complaints department supplied a phone number that is not available. The process is so obtuse I do not know how any elderly person could successfully make a claim and, meanwhile, my aunt’s money is running out.LM, Lisburn, UlsterThis is a devastating situation for you and your aunt, who took such care to provide for her old age, and Phoenix’s indifference to her plight is breathtaking. The timeline you have compiled makes dismal reading. Your many phone calls chasing for updates were kept on hold for 30 minutes at a time, and you were several times then directed to a new number and forced to begin the wait again.
