Leicester versus Southampton offers the vague promise of some crisis-baton rubbernecking, Brentford’s trip to Fulham has the potential to be the most polite local derby in Premier League history, and if New Arsenal are planning on revealing themselves as Old Spurs, then Bournemouth is the very place for all those box-fresh hopes of progress to crumble to dust. As for Newcastle United’s chances of taking anything from Manchester City, we point you in the direction of Eddie Howe’s record against the Citizens of 12 matches played, 12 losses, five goals scored, 39 against, and all without facing Erling Haaland. God speed the Foxes, Saints, Gunners and especially the Toon, but very little of it screams jaw-dropping, eye-popping, interesting-first-paragraph-inspiring action.

A number of variables were mentioned but one in particular was cited as the primary reason: “Raw meat-eating Afrikaners.”Agnew then reached for a collective noun for these brutish seamers who feast on biltong from the time they can chew. The Beeb’s statistician, Andy Zaltzman, whose father is South African, offered the term “herd”.

It was half-time in Manchester United’s Europa League game against Midtjylland, and one of the world’s most celebrated coaches was trying to impart a few words of wisdom to the 18-year-old striker making his first-team debut.“Stay between the width of the six-yard box,” he assured Rashford, “and you’ll score.” In the second half, Rashford took Van Gaal’s advice on board. He was rewarded with two close-range goals, United won 5-1 and Van Gaal had seen enough to hand Rashford a Premier League debut against Arsenal that weekend. Rashford would finish the season with eight goals, a place in Roy Hodgson’s Euro 2016 squad, but above all the impression that this teenage sensation could be anything he wanted.

Jonny Bairstow has joined the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders, Jos Buttler has signed for the Paarl Royals, Samit Patel, Will Smeed and Jordan Thompson have all been picked up by Mumbai Indians’ Emirates team, Sam Curran and Liam Livingstone by their side based in Cape Town. Each one is a sign of changing times. It felt like two smaller, but more significant, press releases out of county cricket got lost among the rush. Darren Stevens has been released by Kent, after 26 seasons on the circuit, and James Hildreth has retired from Somerset, after 19.Stevens hasn’t given up on cricket yet. He told the BBC: “I still feel like I can do a job with bat and ball,” and you can imagine him saying much the same thing to the nurse leaning over him on his deathbed. Stevens, who has the indefatigable optimism of a man who has spent his 40s bowling medium pace against the best batsmen in England, was never going to leave the game of his own volition. Hildreth, though, really has finished. He was going to play out the rest of the season, but he brought his retirement forward after he injured a hamstring in a one-day game against Durham last week. It’s a quietly understated exit for a quiet and understated player.
