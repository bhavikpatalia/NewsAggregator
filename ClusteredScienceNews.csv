As a doctor, I am desperate for the system to change, theguardian.com, 13 August). He is absolutely right to recommend a patient-led approach for doctors, but this is also necessary for all health and social care providers.The treatment for those with long Covid and other post-Covid issues presents a once- in-a-generation opportunity to use patient insight to shape how complex health conditions are treated. Two years into my own long Covid recovery, I was invited by Health Systems Innovation Lab at London South Bank University to take part in a series of workshops involving health and social care professionals (including clinicians).

"47","New cancer treatment offers hope to patients out of options","1661144429000","Exclusive: UK trial finds finds combination of drugs can work where tumours have become resistant to immunotherapyA new cancer treatment can stop the disease advancing in patients who are resistant to immunotherapy, doctors have discovered.Immunotherapy uses the immune system to target and kill cancer cells, and can save lives when other treatment options, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, have failed. However, it cannot help all patients, and some tumours can evolve to resist it.Now oncologists in the UK have found a two-pronged treatment – immunotherapy combined with guadecitabine, a novel experimental drug – can reverse a cancer’s resistance to immunotherapy. Patients expected to die after exhausting all treatment options survived much longer, they found.The combination of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, and guadecitabine, a next-generation DNA hypomethylating agent, halted the advance of cancer in more than a third of patients enrolled in the early phase 1 trial. The results are published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer.The dual combination could become an effective new weapon against several forms of cancer, experts at the Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust said.Patients in the trial, from the Royal Marsden and University College London hospital, included those with lung, breast, prostate and bowel cancer.“I think one of the most important things about this trial is that we used multiple different methods to look for changes in the immune system, robustly showing that it was being influenced by the combination treatment,” the study’s chief investigator, Prof Johann de Bono, said.De Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research and a consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden, added: “In the long term we hope that if these effects are confirmed in other patient groups and future studies, guadecitabine and pembrolizumab could help to tackle some of the resistance to immunotherapy we see in too many types of cancer.”The study used pembrolizumab and guadecitabine to treat 34 cancer patients, 30 of whom had their tumours analysed for immune activity and cancer growth. Every three weeks for three years, they had an injection of guadecitabine for four days in a row – and pembrolizumab on the first of those days.Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug that has already proved successful in treating a range of cancers, including lung and skin cancers. However, tumours can develop resistance to it and some patients who initially benefit will eventually get sicker.

"49","The Guardian view on de-extinction: Jurassic Park may be becoming reality | Editorial","1660929916000","We should be keeping endangered species alive rather than bringing animals back from extinctionThe last official sighting of a Tasmanian tiger in the wild occurred in 1930, when it was shot by a farmer. The marsupials, formally known as thylacines, were hunted to extinction by European settlers who considered them a threat to their sheep and poultry. However, the 6ft-long creatures may reappear if a group of biotechnologists have their way.The company Colossal Biosciences, along with researchers from the University of Melbourne, plans to “de-extinct” the thylacine by using gene-editing technology. Australia has the fastest rate of mammal extinction in the world; disappearances are down to the arrival of foreign species and wildfires linked to the climate crisis. Scientists argue that in Tasmania the loss of the thylacine left the numbers of smaller marsupials unchecked, leading to over-grazing and threatening a fragile ecological balance.

"54","From the archive: What are the hidden costs of our obsession with fish oil pills? | podcast","1660622447000","They may be one of the world’s favourite supplements but, according to a study from earlier this year, more than one in 10 fish oil capsules are rancid. Most of the oil comes from Peruvian anchovetas, a type of anchovy that is also used to feed pigs, poultry and farmed fish. And despite catching more than 4m tonnes a year of anchovetas to cater to the global demand, large industry players want to scale this up even further.In this episode from January 2022, Madeleine Finlay speaks to environment journalist Richa Syal about why so many fish oil pills are rancid, and hears from journalist Dan Collyns in Chimbote, Peru, about how the industry is affecting the local environment and its residentsArchive: The Doctors, ICIJ, Frontline PBS Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2022/aug/16/from-the-archive-what-are-the-hidden-costs-of-our-obsession-with-fish-oil-supplements","46","SCIENCE"
"55","Wednesday briefing: The telescope revealing the secrets of the universe","1661318882000","In today’s newsletter: After the James Webb space telescope sends extraordinary images of Jupiter, astrophysicist Dr Becky Smethurst explains why it’s so importantGood morning. I was going to email you this morning about Liz Truss, but the idea filled me with such dread that I thought: sod it, let’s do the ineffable mysteries of the universe instead.On Christmas Day last year, 30 years after its conception, the James Webb space telescope launched from French Guiana. On 28 December, it went past the moon. On 24 January, it fired its thrusters for five minutes and settled into its final orbit about 1.5m km from Earth. On 12 July, after months of painstaking setup, it produced its first image – showing us, for the first time, faraway galaxies as they were more than 13bn years ago.Food | Companies at the centre of the global grain trade have enjoyed a record bonanza amid soaring food prices around the world, prompting calls for a windfall tax. The figures renewed concerns of profiteering and speculation in global food markets that could put staples beyond the reach of the poorest.UK News | An attempted public murder of a senior gang member caused a nine-year-old girl to be mistakenly shot dead while being shielded by her mother inside her Liverpool home, the Guardian has learned. Bouquets and cards were left outside the home of Olivia Pratt-Korbel amid widespread horror in her city at the killing.Conservatives | Liz Truss has refused to commit to appointing an ethics adviser if she became prime minister, saying she has “always acted with integrity”. The previous ethics adviser, Christopher Geidt, quit in June after conceding Boris Johnson may have broken the ministerial code over the Partygate scandal.UK News | The student nurse Owami Davies, who had been missing for nearly seven weeks, has been found “safe and well”, the Met police has said. Concerns had grown for the 24-year-old’s safety since she was last seen on 7 July.Coronavirus | Twice as many deaths involving Covid occurred this summer as last summer, according to analysis of new data. Some 5,700 Covid deaths have been registered since 8 June – but rates have fallen in recent weeks.

Seriously?”I was texting my best friend to complain after I finished reading yet another cocktail history book that seemed to forget women exist. Months earlier, she had introduced me to the world of craft drinks. After years of being too intimidated to ask a bartender for anything more interesting than a vodka soda, I became immediately fascinated. There was so much talent and alchemy in the making of a cocktail that, for the first time in my life, I began to think more deeply about alcohol. I wanted to try more drinks, visit more bars, and most importantly, I wanted to learn.
