But is it down to long Covid? The months of isolation during lockdown? Or just poor public hygiene?It might be one of the hottest summers on record, but the warm weather hasn’t stopped Lorraine Davies, 35, and her family from catching every virus going. “Since spring it feels like our whole family has been constantly unwell,” she says. “I have had at least four viruses in the past few months. As a busy mum, I’ve just had to try to carry on. There have been days where I’ve put the children to bed and then just fallen asleep because I’m so knackered.”It’s not the first time they have been hit with a wave of summer viruses since the pandemic began. Last year, her youngest child ended up in A&amp;E with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a cold-like bug that can cause severe illness in babies. “This summer we’ve all had colds, coughs, stomach bugs, as well as Covid. I don’t think we’ve ever been to the doctor this much.” Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/22/colds-coughs-stomach-bugs-why-are-so-many-of-us-getting-winter-diseases-this-summer"

We know it’s not possible, so why do we keep falling for it?When I was 14, my family moved from Sydney to London. Before we left a friend pulled me aside, eyes wide with envy, and said, “You know, you can be anyone you want now. You can totally reinvent yourself.” This was before social media, when the idea of a personal online history following us across an ocean like a problematic ex wasn’t a thing.At the time I felt there was a bright, aspirational magic to my friend’s words.

Colchicine, in the form of the autumn crocus, was used as early as 1500BC to treat joint swelling. The plant is highly toxic because of the colchicine, so my GP will only prescribe 12 tablets at a time. But they do work, without the side-effects of painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol.Paddy MoindrotLlanfyllin, Powys• In contrast to the letters about tactless firms making grieving worse (14 August), I would like to pay tribute to the government’s Tell Us Once service, which I found when my wife died a few months ago. It offers a list of public services that can be selected if they seem likely to be relevant, and they will be informed following a single message with the details.

Seriously?”I was texting my best friend to complain after I finished reading yet another cocktail history book that seemed to forget women exist. Months earlier, she had introduced me to the world of craft drinks. After years of being too intimidated to ask a bartender for anything more interesting than a vodka soda, I became immediately fascinated. There was so much talent and alchemy in the making of a cocktail that, for the first time in my life, I began to think more deeply about alcohol. I wanted to try more drinks, visit more bars, and most importantly, I wanted to learn.

Then you need to address the reasons your relationship ended in the first placeI was married to a wonderful man for 30 years. We had a great relationship, and shared many interests and a sense of humour. I had been sterilised before we met, so he understood we would never have children, which was not a problem.In the last six years of our marriage we were no longer having sex as I had lost interest, but he assured me it really wasn’t a problem at all. However, an opportunity arose with a woman he met through work, and they ended up having sex. They met when he was helping with some personal issues while working on her house. She became pregnant. He felt he had to do the honourable thing, and left me to live with her and the baby.

"89","I could be naked in front of my wife and she still wouldn’t want sex. Even our honeymoon left me frustrated","1661238005000","I’m sick of always having to make the first move – and usually being turned down. After four years like this, should we get professional help?I am a woman in my 30s who has been in a relationship with my partner (also a woman) for almost four years. Our sex life has never been amazing, but we love each other deeply and when we do have sex it is good. But the frequency is low – we are intimate once every couple of months and she never initiates sex. We recently married and during our week’s  honeymoon had sex once. I’m at the end of my tether with frustration and sadness that she doesn’t seem to want to sleep with me. I’ve tried to talk to her about what’s going on and she is generally dismissive, putting it down to our busy lives. When I brought up the honeymoon and the fact that I was rejected numerous times during a week when we were both relaxed, she didn’t have a response. Is it time to see a sex therapist? I do not want a sexless or low-sex marriage. I love my wife very much, and I don’t doubt that she loves me, but it’s really starting to affect the way I feel about myself. I could wear the hottest outfit or nothing at all and she still wouldn’t make a move. What can we do to change things?A good sex therapist could certainly help. An imbalance of sexual interest between partners can be a source of enormous frustration for both. It can create resentment, anger and even lead to a break-up. With help, you could both gain clarity about each other’s needs, reach an understanding, learn to communicate better – and have the best chance of resolving the situation. Sometimes there is a medical or psychological reason for low desire, and a sex therapist can help identify factors that require special attention. Unfortunately, many people passively accept such an impasse, which – as you have already discovered – can have a devastating effect on one’s self-esteem.

Be less hard on yourself and learn to make ‘I statements’The question I can’t seem to stop gossiping and complaining about the people around me. This primarily happens at work and I am not the only person who does it; it is a toxic environment where bitching is the norm, so it is hard to resist. Every day I give myself a little talk about how I am not going to say a bad word about someone and every day I get sucked into gossip or end up saying something mean. It is the trait I deplore the most in myself and I am starting to believe that deep down I am a horrible person who doesn’t deserve any friends. I used to pride myself on my ability to be honest, opinionated and outspoken, but the balance has tipped into bitterness, whining and impulsive gossiping. The worst part is, when I bitch about someone, I deep down don’t feel negatively about them and am baffled as to why I say such horrible things.I have worked hard on myself in the last few years (becoming sober, going to therapy) and I am ashamed that I have not evolved into a better person. I don’t want to be small-minded by getting a thrill out of bringing others down. I really respect and admire people who are more positive, open minded and can control their thoughts and emotions around others – how do I become that person and say goodbye once and for all to this poisonous part of myself?

But that wasn’t the feat that got him into Guinness World Records …Len Collingwood, a clinical nurse specialist in psychotherapy, retired on his 65th birthday. He had made a deal with his wife, Sally: she would train as a yoga teacher and he would “start out as an adventure cyclist”.Four months later, he set off on a 13,000km cycle ride from Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia to Edinburgh, much of it roughly shadowing Marco Polo’s Silk Road. No sooner had he started out than a snowstorm hit. He hid in his tent, wearing every item of clothing he had packed. At -18C it was too cold to venture outside to cook. He survived the next 48 hours by eating a “massive bag of Snickers and Crunchies” his colleagues had given him when he retired.

We all laugh because how could anyone forget to notice the stunning sweep of the Dolomites unfurling above the forested valley behind him. But we know he’s right. Because for the next eight hours or so, most of us will be lost in a world of self-inflicted torment as we pedal agonisingly up vertiginous hills, only to plummet with our hearts in our mouths down the other side, before doing it again, and again… We are in Italy’s picturesque South Tyrol to take part in the glorious Maratona dles Dolomites – Enel. It’s one of the hardest – and almost certainly the most scenic – one-day bike races in the world.Mountains and bicycles aren’t natural bedfellows. Defying the thigh-burning power of gravity tends to spoil what could be a blissful union. But the annual Maratona manages to celebrate the jaw-dropping beauty of this brutal landscape by sending 8,000 Lycra-clad riders up and down seven of its most famous peaks. And, despite the fact that almost every single one of us will spend the day cursing the absurdity of cycling uphill, none of us would have it any other way. The spellbinding physical beauty of the Dolomites will take your breath away in more ways than you could imagine.
