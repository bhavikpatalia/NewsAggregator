I’d hate to speculate | John Naughton","1659798017000","For the first time in the technology industry’s history, combined real revenue growth is negative rather than positive and some corporations may yet be facing an existential decline  A speculative bubble, wrote Nobel laureate Robert Shiller in Irrational Exuberance, his landmark book on human foolishness, is “a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors, who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement”.Observers of the tech industry are wearily familiar with this kind of irrationality. Throughout 2020 and 2021, as Covid-19 wreaked economic havoc on countries throughout the western world, the tech industry remained strangely untouched by what was happening on the ground. While the rest of us cowered in lockdown, the pandemic made tech bosses and owners insanely richer. Their companies grew faster and became even more profitable while other industries languished. Apple had so much extra cash that it spent $90bn (£74bn) – nearly the gross domestic product of Kenya – buying its own shares. Amazon laid out $50bn in 2021 on warehouses, hiring tens of thousands of employees, ordering fleets of electric vehicles and building cloud computing centres. And so on.

We embraced the cycles of time that occur in the forest,” says Andrews, the film’s director. “That letting go and surrendering gave us time to listen, and gain a deep appreciation of the multi-layered nature of that environment.”Their experience in the 180m-year-old rainforest, which literally re-shaped their sense of time, has never left them.

The book had tanked during the pandemic and she had been dropped by her literary agent. Then, on 13 March 2021, she decided to take to TikTok, asking her followers if they would: “read a book about a cursed island that only appears once every 100 years to host a game that gives the six rulers of the realm a chance to break their curses.” One of the rulers must die, the short video revealed, “even as love complicates everything” for the heroine, Isla Crown.Aster didn’t expect much, especially when she checked in a few hours later to see that her post had only clocked up about 1,000 views. Maybe the books world was right, she thought. Maybe there wasn’t a market for Lightlark, a young adult story she had been writing and rewriting for years, to no interest from publishers. The next day, however, she woke up to see her video had been viewed more than a million times. A week later, Lightlark had gone to auction and she had a six-figure deal with Amulet Books. Last month, Universal preemptively bought the film rights for, in her words, “more zeros than I’ve seen in my life”.

Farmers today produce more than 73m tonnes of it each year – more than double the amount of 20 years ago. But the rapid growth of palm fruit plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia has caused major deforestation and human rights issues.An industry-wide shift to sustainable palm oil is therefore urgently needed. Palm oil supply chains are long and complex, however, spanning multiple traders, storage tanks, pipelines and oil tankers. It’s difficult and expensive for companies to establish fully segregated supply chains for sustainable palm oil, so batches that have been produced sustainably are often shipped in bulk and commingled with conventional palm oil.

"118","Rollerdrome review – skating as a bloodsport","1660654845000","PC, PlayStation 4/5; Roll7/Private DivisionMixing the colour palette of 80s comic books with post-apocalyptic bloodlust, movement in this fluid game feels sublime. Until you get shot in the headSkating of all kinds became a whole thing during the Covid lockdowns. As the pandemic put a pause on indoor socialising, parks became the new pubs – and what better way to escape shut-in misery than gliding around the green? In south London at least, it’s a passion that’s endured: every Sunday without fail, I’m greeted by a gaggle of boombox-toting skaters. Yet for game developer Roll7, this lockdown obsession seemingly took a less wholesome turn. If you ever thought that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater would be more thrilling as a blood-drenched deathmatch, then this is your game.Channelling the smudged colour palette of 80s comic books and the post-apocalyptic bloodlust of Mad Max, Rollerdrome is a giddying blend of murder and momentum. As in February’s brilliant OlliOlli World, from the same developer, forward motion feels sublime: performing mid-air grabs atop a ramp before dropping into a polished, gym-like court, the fluidity of your flow is entrancing. And then some other deadly derby competitor shoots you in the head. Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/16/rollerdrome-review-skating-as-a-bloodsport"
"119","Pushing Buttons: Breaking Bad meets GTA – and other shows I’d like to play","1660647199000","Game adaptations don’t have to be terrible. But as Better Call Saul creator Vince Gilligan admits, bringing action from screen to console isn’t as easy as it soundsDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up hereWelcome back to Pushing Buttons! This issue is going out on my birthday. Presents would be nice, but what I actually want is a week off to finally play Elden Ring. Only slightly more importantly, today is also when the finale of Better Call Saul airs in the UK, closing out a story that began with Breaking Bad’s first TV episodes in 2008. I will really miss this series – there is nothing in television quite like creator Vince Gilligan’s sumptuous shots and tight dark-comedic writing. I’ve often wondered why there’s been no Breaking Bad video game – especially because Netflix has shown a great deal of interest in the games, from buying studios to bankrolling endless TV adaptations. (Side note: did you know that Netflix subscribers get access to 24 mostly excellent games for free, including the sci-fi masterpiece Into the Breach? I didn’t, until last week.)I would have expected some drug-empire management game, maybe spliced with scenes from the show, or with scene-setting and dialogue from its writers. Or perhaps an interactive-movie tie-in along the lines of Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, where your reactions send the story spinning off in different directions. It would be expensive, sure, but Netflix has never minded spending money.Microsoft stopped disclosing sales figures for Xbox consoles long ago, but early in the PlayStation 4/Xbox One era it was fairly clear that the PS4 was streets ahead. It comes as no surprise, then, to learn that the PS4 outsold the Xbox One by more than two to one, as revealed by court documents. Is it any wonder that Microsoft prefers to frame the console wars on its own terms and talk about Game Pass subscribers and engagement instead?The Pokémon world championships are in London this week for the first time. The tournaments will be live-streamed, but Pokémon fans can also pay £10 to go and spectate.

Look no further than the iconography of Doom, or Tim Schafer’s Brütal Legend, for evidence of that. But it was in the mid 00s – during the reign of music and rhythm games such as Guitar Hero – that the link was most obvious. Count me among the ranks of those who learned about Pantera and Megadeth by way of the plastic instrument.Which is why this year’s Metal: Hellsinger is on my radar. The game is a cross between a first person shooter and a rhythm game: by matching your shooting to the tempo of the music, you build a score multiplier that increases the damage you deal. We’ve seen this before in BPM: Bullets Per Minute, but Metal: Hellsinger brings its own setting and original heavy metal soundtrack to the party.

During these competitive 90-minute fixtures, all participants, including subs and officials, wore advanced Xsens motion capture suits that recorded their every movement, shot, tackle and celebration. Involving more than 70 people it was, according to gameplay producer Sam Rivera, the largest number of players ever motion-captured in a single session.Every year, the developers of Fifa tell us that their key aim is authenticity. This year, Fifa 23 – the final product of EA Sports and Fifa’s 30-year partnership – is about making key moments more intelligible, detailed and dramatic, zooming in ever closer to the action at pitch level. That grand Zaragoza mo-cap session provided 10m frames of animation – twice as much match capture as Fifa 22 – allowing for more than 6,000 authentic player animations, a wealth of which are female-specific.

"122","Arcade Paradise review – enjoy some 90s retro vibes  in this tribute to classic games","1660222843000","PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4/5; Nosebleed Interactive/Wired ProductionsThis unusual game has you managing your dad’s launderette while running a secret arcade out the backIt’s the early 1990s, and you – a college dropout – have been tasked with babysitting your chronically disappointed father’s launderette business. It is not an exciting job. You pick up rubbish, you unclog the toilet, you load laundry into machines and take it out again. But in the back room, there’s a small collection of arcade machines to help customers while away the time as their shirts dry, and there’s enough money in their coin hoppers to buy a whole new cabinet. And so you begin the slow process of secretly transforming your father’s business into a thriving arcade, reinvesting the cash you make from washing people’s dirty underwear into buying more video games.Arcade Paradise is a low-key management simulator that goes at its own, fairly languid pace. You don’t have an enormous amount of influence over how much money you make or how fast you can expand; you do the laundry, and play games, and wait for money to accumulate. Dealing with customers’ clothes quickly gets you bonus cash, but why would you sit by the washing machine when you could be playing on the arcade cabinets round the back? There are more than 30 of them to collect, all charmingly inspired by 70s, 80s and 90s classics: there’s a cross between GTA and Pac-Man, a couple of twists on Space Invaders, a match-three puzzle adventure game, a zombie shooter. Frustratingly, they tend to require more time from you than the average wash cycle, so you have to choose between competently running the laundry and spending a satisfying amount of time with a game.Arcade Paradise is out now; £15.99 Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/11/arcade-paradise-review-enjoy-some-90s-retro-in-this-tribute-to-classic-games-launderette-pc-xbox-nintento-playstation"

A glimmering, glass figure pushes off on a board, the camera tracking them at a low angle just as it would in a skate film. The rumble of the wheels on the concrete is authentically loud, the accompanying beats delightfully chill, and towering purple buildings refract trippily in the background.
