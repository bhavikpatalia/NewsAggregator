What could possibly go wrong?It all started with the headline over an entry in Charlie Warzel’s Galaxy Brain newsletter in the Atlantic: “Where Does Alex Jones Go From Here?” This is an interesting question because Jones is an internet troll so extreme that he makes Donald Trump look like Spinoza. For many years, he has parlayed a radio talkshow and a website into a comfortable multimillion-dollar business peddling nonsense, conspiracy theories, falsehoods and weird merchandise to a huge tribe of adherents. And until 4 August he had got away with it. On that day, though, he lost an epic defamation case brought against him by parents of children who died in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre – a tragedy that he had consistently ridiculed as a staged hoax; a Texas jury decided that he should pay nearly $50m in damages for publishing this sadistic nonsense.Warzel’s newsletter consisted of an interview with someone who had worked for the Jones media empire in its heyday and, as such, was interesting. But what really caught my eye was the striking illustration that headed the piece. It showed a cartoonish image of a dishevelled Jones in some kind of cavern surrounded by papers, banknotes, prescriptions and other kinds of documents. Rather good, I thought, and then inspected the caption to see who the artist was. The answer: “AI art by Midjourney”.

I’d hate to speculate | John Naughton","1659798017000","For the first time in the technology industry’s history, combined real revenue growth is negative rather than positive and some corporations may yet be facing an existential decline  A speculative bubble, wrote Nobel laureate Robert Shiller in Irrational Exuberance, his landmark book on human foolishness, is “a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors, who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement”.Observers of the tech industry are wearily familiar with this kind of irrationality. Throughout 2020 and 2021, as Covid-19 wreaked economic havoc on countries throughout the western world, the tech industry remained strangely untouched by what was happening on the ground. While the rest of us cowered in lockdown, the pandemic made tech bosses and owners insanely richer. Their companies grew faster and became even more profitable while other industries languished. Apple had so much extra cash that it spent $90bn (£74bn) – nearly the gross domestic product of Kenya – buying its own shares. Amazon laid out $50bn in 2021 on warehouses, hiring tens of thousands of employees, ordering fleets of electric vehicles and building cloud computing centres. And so on.

They were reacting to Instagram’s attempt to wrest Gen Z eyeballs away from TikTok by mimicking some of the app’s signature features.Early social media platforms such as MySpace and Facebook were built on the quaint notion of “friends”, mirroring your real-life social networks online. But the ruthless dynamics of the attention economy mean that the platforms most popular with young people today, Instagram and TikTok, double as global arenas to launch influencer careers.

We might invoke grandchildren, at a push great-grandchildren, but after that, it all becomes a bit vague and, well, unimaginable.And while we look with awe and fascination at the Egyptian pyramids, built 5,000 years ago, we seem incapable of thinking, or even contemplating, 5,000 years in the future. That lies in the realm of science fiction, which is tantamount to fantasy. But the chances are, barring a global catastrophe, humanity will still be very much around in 5,000 years, and going by the average existence of mammal species, should still be thriving in 500,000 years.

But the rapid growth of palm fruit plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia has caused major deforestation and human rights issues.An industry-wide shift to sustainable palm oil is therefore urgently needed. Palm oil supply chains are long and complex, however, spanning multiple traders, storage tanks, pipelines and oil tankers. It’s difficult and expensive for companies to establish fully segregated supply chains for sustainable palm oil, so batches that have been produced sustainably are often shipped in bulk and commingled with conventional palm oil.

"124","In The Callisto Protocol, dark and terrible things lurk in space","1660899611000","One of the minds behind deeply unsettling sci-fi classic Dead Space imagines another haunted, forsaken space station in this forthcoming horror gameAn unnamed convict staggers through a lunar prison that’s been sundered by some sort of galactic catastrophe. The steely corridors are shrouded in darkness, save for the neon glow of computer terminals. Every step is tentative, because pulsating monstrosities – other prisoners, mutated into abominable forms – threaten to emerge from every crevice.Few versions of hell loom larger in the imagination than the haunted, derelict space station. You’re alone in the dark, far from home, and stalked by whatever horrors have leaked in from the cosmic void. Steve Papoutsis has been obsessed with this bleak fantasy for years: he worked as a producer on the vaunted Dead Space series, which condemned gamers to their own forsaken Nostromo. The Callisto Protocol, which arrives on consoles and PC later this year, is pitched as a spiritual successor to that franchise. Papoutsis is at the helm once again, and wants to show us just how terrifying the final frontier can be.

"126","The Last Worker paints a picture of a fully-automated future where Amazon rules the world","1660726811000","What would you do if you were the last human left working at a nightmarish future-version of an Amazon warehouse?There can’t be many of us left who’ve never ordered a package from Amazon, despite increasing awareness of the human cost behind that convenience. Upcoming game The Last Worker, the first from developer Oiffy, is a dark comedic take on the horror and absurdity of the online-retail “fulfilment centre”. In an age where we just accept corporate billionaires raking in obscene profit at the expense of an underpaid workforce as a sad fact of life, this game might be the chance we need to find the humour in it all.The Last Worker is a story seen through the eyes of its protagonist, Kurt, set in a world where automation has reached dystopian heights. Kurt is the last human employee working in an otherwise fully automated fulfilment centre for Jüngle, an online retailer which totally isn’t up to anything sinister. His job is to get packaged orders ready for shipping and he’s never made a mistake in 25 years of service, which is the only reason he hasn’t been replaced with a robot. He takes some pride in his work, but when he becomes the reluctant recruit of an anti-Jüngle activist group, might he be pressured into stealthily sabotaging the company?The Last Worker will be out later this year on PC, Switch, Xbox, PS5 and Oculus Quest.

Until you get shot in the headSkating of all kinds became a whole thing during the Covid lockdowns. As the pandemic put a pause on indoor socialising, parks became the new pubs – and what better way to escape shut-in misery than gliding around the green? In south London at least, it’s a passion that’s endured: every Sunday without fail, I’m greeted by a gaggle of boombox-toting skaters. Yet for game developer Roll7, this lockdown obsession seemingly took a less wholesome turn. If you ever thought that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater would be more thrilling as a blood-drenched deathmatch, then this is your game.Channelling the smudged colour palette of 80s comic books and the post-apocalyptic bloodlust of Mad Max, Rollerdrome is a giddying blend of murder and momentum. As in February’s brilliant OlliOlli World, from the same developer, forward motion feels sublime: performing mid-air grabs atop a ramp before dropping into a polished, gym-like court, the fluidity of your flow is entrancing. And then some other deadly derby competitor shoots you in the head. Continue reading...","https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/16/rollerdrome-review-skating-as-a-bloodsport"

But as Better Call Saul creator Vince Gilligan admits, bringing action from screen to console isn’t as easy as it soundsDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up hereWelcome back to Pushing Buttons! This issue is going out on my birthday. Presents would be nice, but what I actually want is a week off to finally play Elden Ring. Only slightly more importantly, today is also when the finale of Better Call Saul airs in the UK, closing out a story that began with Breaking Bad’s first TV episodes in 2008. I will really miss this series – there is nothing in television quite like creator Vince Gilligan’s sumptuous shots and tight dark-comedic writing. I’ve often wondered why there’s been no Breaking Bad video game – especially because Netflix has shown a great deal of interest in the games, from buying studios to bankrolling endless TV adaptations. (Side note: did you know that Netflix subscribers get access to 24 mostly excellent games for free, including the sci-fi masterpiece Into the Breach? I didn’t, until last week.)I would have expected some drug-empire management game, maybe spliced with scenes from the show, or with scene-setting and dialogue from its writers. Or perhaps an interactive-movie tie-in along the lines of Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, where your reactions send the story spinning off in different directions. It would be expensive, sure, but Netflix has never minded spending money.Microsoft stopped disclosing sales figures for Xbox consoles long ago, but early in the PlayStation 4/Xbox One era it was fairly clear that the PS4 was streets ahead. It comes as no surprise, then, to learn that the PS4 outsold the Xbox One by more than two to one, as revealed by court documents. Is it any wonder that Microsoft prefers to frame the console wars on its own terms and talk about Game Pass subscribers and engagement instead?The Pokémon world championships are in London this week for the first time.

Look no further than the iconography of Doom, or Tim Schafer’s Brütal Legend, for evidence of that. But it was in the mid 00s – during the reign of music and rhythm games such as Guitar Hero – that the link was most obvious. Count me among the ranks of those who learned about Pantera and Megadeth by way of the plastic instrument.Which is why this year’s Metal: Hellsinger is on my radar. The game is a cross between a first person shooter and a rhythm game: by matching your shooting to the tempo of the music, you build a score multiplier that increases the damage you deal. We’ve seen this before in BPM: Bullets Per Minute, but Metal: Hellsinger brings its own setting and original heavy metal soundtrack to the party.
